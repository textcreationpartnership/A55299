            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Arts and Sciences are in compariſon but the Poor of the Mind, the Riches and Treaſures of Knowledge lie in
<pb facs="tcp:57359:3"/>Evangelical Mysteries; theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine the Sun, and out-weigh the Earth: They have the highest Certainty, as coming down imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from heaven; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the noblest Tendency, as leading us thither: Infinite Truth is the Fountain, and infinite Goodneſs the Center of them. Theſe, when in their Lustre, make a ſpiritual Day, and derive ſuch a pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Hearts and Lives of Men, as moulds them into the Divine Image, and thereby makes them meet for the bliſs-making Viſion in Heaven. No ſooner can theſe be under an Eclipſe, but there will be a Night and a <hi>Chaos</hi> of confuſions; the Path of Life and Happineſs will be wrapt up in darkneſs; black Legions of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Corruptions will creep forth, and pious Souls will wiſh for the day, I mean, for a freſh
<pb facs="tcp:57359:3"/>Illuſtration of Truths from that ſacred Spirit, which at first breah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them out into the World; and, after all the Clouds and dark Veils put upon them, can bring them forth in their Oriency and true Glory. Theſe to Believers are as Pearls and ſacred Jewels, dearer than the Apple of their Eye, nay, than their own Souls: They build upon them by Faith, eſpouſe them by divine Love, lay them up in a pure Conſcience, diſtil the Vertue of them into a holy Life; and, if it were poſſible, they would have none of the ſacred Light put out, nor the least Jot or Tittle of thoſe Truths fall to the ground. O what a rate did the famous St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and others ſet upon God's ſpecial Effectual Grace! How highly did the heroical <hi>Luther</hi> value the Point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication! <hi>Jacente articulo Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificationis

When ſuch Truths are violated, Christians, how meek ſoever in other things, muſt earnestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and not give place, no, not for an hour; here, if ever, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's pia &amp; ſancta pertinacia</hi> is in ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Not to ſtay any longer on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and great Concerns of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Truths, which no tongue of Men or Angels is able fully to expreſs. I ſhall now ſpeak a little touching Mr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Book. When I read it, I thought my ſelf in a new Theological World; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers appearing without their Head for want of a Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtrip'd and naked for lack of imputed Righteouſneſs; the full treaſures of Grace in Chriſt, which have ſupplied all the veſſels of faith, emptied out of ſacred his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb facs="tcp:57359:4"/>&amp; transfuſed into the doctrine of the Goſpel; as if according to <hi>Pelagius</hi> all Grace were in doctrine only: The holy Spirit, the great Origen of Graces and Comforts, in its Illumination ſeems to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, in its Teſtimony to Believers an Enthuſiastical Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and in the work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, if any, at most but a partial Co-cauſe, parting ſtakes with the Will of Man: Faith in <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> lying as low as Natural Principles; in <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> raiſed up a little to particular Revelations, but not ſo high as the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> In Christians ſtanding off and at a distance from Chriſt its dear Object, not daring to lay hold on, or ſo much as touch him, to draw any Vertue from thence. As if <hi>Socinus</hi> had hit it right, when he ſaid,
<pb facs="tcp:57359:5"/>
               <hi>Chriſti apprehenſio merum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum &amp; inaniſſimum ſomnium eſt.</hi> The immutable Love of God, the only Cement of the Church, ſeems to be turned off from Perſons to Qualities, and towards Perſons to be as variable as the fickle Will of Man is; and yet he is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſtill, he loves for the ſame Reaſon, or, as <hi>Socinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non ſine cauſa mutat.</hi> The Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifician <hi>Theſis</hi> touching Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by inherent Righteouſneſs, ſeems to be revived a freſh, and that in a way leſs tolerable than among the Romaniſts: They, though they would have inherent Righteouſneſs come in for a ſhare, yet allow the Imputation of Chriſts paſſive Obedience; but in the New Scheme, inherent Righteouſneſs takes up all the room, and leaves none for imputed. The Drollery and ſarcaſtical Reflections in the
<pb facs="tcp:57359:5"/>Book are but the Cover of it; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is a dark Eclipſe upon many excellent Truths which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have been owned in the Churches of Chriſt, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our own. Among other Truths none have had a greater ſhare of ſuffering than thoſe two, touching our Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, and the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to us; both which are to me very momentous. The Mystical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion hath I ſuppoſe, been generally received in the Church. Indeed <hi>Gregory de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia</hi> once cavilled at it, as if it were <hi>Myſterium Calviniſticum;</hi> and yet he ſeems to own it, when he ſaith, <hi>Animum noſtrum poſſe per fidem corpus Chriſti, etiam ut in coelo exiſtens, atque adeo ut eſt extra Sacramentum mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care.</hi> He that denies the Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, cannot hold <hi>the head
<pb facs="tcp:57359:6"/>Jeſus Chriſt, from which all the body by joynts and bands hath nouriſhment miniſtred,</hi> Col. <hi>2.19.</hi> Take away that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and Chriſt is a Head of no Influence, the Joynts and the Bands, which were made to convey divine Nutriture from him, are but empty Titles, and ſignifie no more than thoſe Conduit-pipes do, which are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Fountain. Again, he that denies the Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, must loſe that piece of his Creed, <hi>the Communion of Saints;</hi> their Communion among themſelves pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily depends on their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt the Head, <hi>from whom the whole body is fitly joyned together and compacted,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph. 4.16.</hi> All the Harmonies in the Body Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hang on its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Head; without this Believers could have no Communion one with
<pb facs="tcp:57359:6"/>another, ſave in this only, that they must all die one common death, hy being ſevered from their Head: The living Stones, once off from their Foundation, can hang no longer together in the ſpiritual Building, but muſt totter down into a <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confuſion. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he that denies the myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, muſt turn off the Believer from his true ſtanding: according to the Goſpel, the Believer is a man in Chriſt; he is built on him, as on a Foundation; he ſubſists in him, as the Branches do in the Vine; he hath vital Influences from him, as the Members have from the Head; he is acted by his divine Spirit in all the pure ways to heaven, and all this is his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, his preſervation in Jeſus Chriſt: But take away the Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, he is a man out of Chriſt, he ſtands upon his own
<pb facs="tcp:57359:7"/>bottom, he ſubſiſts by himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he receives no influences from Chriſt the Head, nor is acted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny higher Spirit than his own; and in ſuch a caſe, the next news we hear of him must be an utter downfall. But to ſay no more of the Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion; that other Point touching the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to us, hath alſo been ever owned in the Church; he that denies it, muſt, I fear, in the conſequent, overturn the Law, the Goſpel, and the Satisfaction of Chriſt. He must overturn the Law; for he muſt own a Juſtification without a Righteouſneſs anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto; inherent Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being imperfect, and imputed a Nullity, there is nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Law, and yet we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, which is as much as to ſay, the Law is no Law: If it be a Law, none can be juſtified without
<pb facs="tcp:57359:7"/>a Righteouſneſs adequate to it; if we may be juſtified without ſuch a Righteouſneſs, the Law is no Law, which is what the <hi>Antinomians</hi> would have: That a Law ſhould be in force, and a man ſhould be juſtified without an adequate Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and that before a moſt righteous Judge, who judgeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, is utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Again he must overturn the Goſpel, and that upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: The one is this: He muſt ſubvert the Promiſes of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in the Goſpel; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes run thus; That we ſhall be <hi>juſtified by Chriſt's blood, made righteous by his obedience;</hi> that <hi>his blood ſhall cleanſe away ſin, and purge our conſciences from dead works;</hi> and how can theſe be fulfilled without an Imputation? To ſay, that Christ's Blood found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Covenant, will not ſerve the
<pb facs="tcp:57359:8"/>turn; theſe are Promiſes of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant founded already, and a founded Covenant doth not promiſe the founding of it ſelf. Chriſts blood as it founded the Covenant, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the Promiſes, and by it as ſuch the Promiſes cannot be fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for then they ſhould be fulfilled before they were made, or at least in the making of them: It remains therefore that Chriſts righteouſneſs muſt be made ours by imputation, &amp; thereby the promiſes may be made good to us. If the Promiſes mean as they ſpeak, then we muſt be juſtified by Chriſts blood &amp; obedience, which infers Imputation; if the Promiſes (how plain, how emphatical ſoever the words be) mean not, that we ſhall be justified by Chriſt's Blood or Righteouſneſs, then Chriſt ſhed his Blood for us, that we might be juſtified without it; he ſatisfied for us, that we might be pardoned
<pb facs="tcp:57359:8"/>without a ſatisfaction, which is an odd reflection on his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if not a total evacuation of it. The other is this; he muſt pervert the Conditions of the Goſpel from their true end and ſcope: Theſe Conditions were in infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom accommodated and attemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the death of Christ which founded them, they were made to be ſubordinate and ſubſervient to Christ's ſatisfaction and the glory of it: The Faith required in them was not intended to be the matter of our Juſtification, and in that notion to diſcharge and juſtifie us; the main ſcope and end of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions was to ſhew upon what terms Christ's righteoſneſs and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ſhould diſcharge and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us. Now as long as theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are made but conditions, as long as Faith keeps its proper ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all is well and as it ought to be; but if thoſe conditions be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb facs="tcp:57359:9"/>above their own ſtation, if our inherent righteouſneſs be made the very matter of our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as indeed it muſt if imputed Righteouſneſs be denied, then the conditions of the Goſpel are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and perverted from their true end, they are no longer ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt's ſatisfaction, but made to ſet up our inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the room of it, they ſhew no longer upon what terms Chriſts ſatisfaction ſhall diſcharge us, but how our own Righteouſneſs may do it, which is plainly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the conditions of the Goſpel. Moreover he muſt overturn the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Christ: Touching this three things are conſiderable, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's ſurrogation in our room, Gods acceptation of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> on our behalf, and the operation of that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in our diſcharge; none of which can ſtand without an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The firſt thing is Chriſt's
<pb facs="tcp:57359:9"/>ſurrogation, he ſuffered <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Matth. 20.28. in ſtead of many;</hi> he was our <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, putting his Soul in the room of ours, or elſe he could not have ſatisfied for us. Now that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer in our room and ſtead, and his ſufferings ſhould not be accounted or imputed to us, is a contradiction; take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Imputation, and you take away Surrogation; take away Surroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and you take away Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The ſecond thing is Gods acceptation of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half: Chriſts Sacrifice was <hi>a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour unto God,</hi> Eph. <hi>5.2.</hi> God accepted it on our behalf, or elſe Chriſt could not have ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for us. Now that Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings ſhould be accepted by God as on our behalf, and yet that they ſhould not be accounted or imputed is utterly impoſſible; ſo far as Chriſts Satisfaction was accepted by God for us, ſo far it must be imputed to
<pb facs="tcp:57359:10"/>us; if it was accepted only for a remiſſibility, then it is imputed no further; but then remiſſion will be without ſatisfaction, which is what the Socinians would have; but if (as the truth is) it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for Remiſſion and Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be diſpenſed upon believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then it is imputed to that end, actually to juſtifie and diſcharge us: Take away Imputation, and you take away Acceptation, and with it Satisfaction. The third thing is the operation of Chriſt's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in our diſcharge. Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is <hi>deſtructio obligationis,</hi> it doth really and properly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him for whom it is made: accepted abſolutely, it diſcharges him immediately; accepted on terms it diſcharges upon the performance, and that as properly and really, though not ſo ſoon as in the other caſe; its vertue and efficacy, which was ſuſpended by the condition,
<pb facs="tcp:57359:10"/>breaks forth into effect upon the performance; this is the nature and property of Satisfaction: A Satisfaction which doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, doth not ſatisfie, that is, in plain terms, it is no Satisfaction. Now the ſatisfaction of Chriſt doth no diſcharge us immediatly, but upon believing, which is the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Condition; and how doth it do it? Surely one of theſe two ways, either it diſcharges us meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it founded the Covenant, or elſe as it is made ours by Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the former cannot be, it found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Covenant before our believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; if it do no more after, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges us not, for it doth as much before believing (before which it diſcharges not) as after: It founded the Covenant for thoſe that periſh, at leaſt ſo far, that upon believing they might have been justified; &amp; if it do no more for thoſe that are ſaved, it diſcharges us not; for it
<pb facs="tcp:57359:11"/>doth operate as much and as far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the diſcharge of thoſe that periſh, who are never diſcharged, as of thoſe that are diſcharged and ſaved; which plainly ſhews, that it properly diſcharges none at all: and if it diſcharge not, it ſatisfies not, that is, it is no ſatisfaction. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore, that Christ's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is made ours by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo doth diſcharge us: If it diſcharge us, it muſt be made ours by Imputation, and if it diſcharge us not, it is no Satisfaction. <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who denied Chriſt's Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, had reaſon to deny imputed Righteouſneſs; and he, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies imputed Righteouſneſs, muſt in the conſequent deny Chriſt's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, nay, he muſt ſet up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſatisfaction in ſtead of it. In Justification there muſt be ſome Righteouſneſs or other, to be the matter of our Juſtification, and to diſcharge us before God; if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb facs="tcp:57359:11"/>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt be not ſuch, then our own inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs muſt be the very thing, that must diſcharge us and ſatisfie for us; that indeed muſt be the ſatisfaction much rather than Christs, becauſe it properly actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcharges us, which Christs doth not: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs we ſay with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that there is Remiſſion without Satisfaction, there must be ſomewhat to be a Satisfaction, and what that is very obvious: That which is the matter of our Justification, that which doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly diſcharge us, that is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: if Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed be not it, our inherent Righteouſneſs muſt be ſuch; and yet alas! what a poor thing is it to be ſo advanced? Its own defects call for a pardon, and how ſhould it juſtif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e or diſcharge us? May that, which wants a pardon it ſelf, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie; or may it first be pardoned it
<pb facs="tcp:57359:12"/>ſelf, and then juſtifie its Subject in which it is? Both are abſurd: Before it is pardoned it ſelf, it cannot justifie; and after it is pardoned, it is very odd, that it ſhould give that which it ſelf once wanted. Not to be tedious; I have endeavoured to return an Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Book, not out of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diſreſpect to his Perſon, who is my acquaintance, and for whom I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; but meerly out of love to the Truth, which is dearer to me than all Relations.

               <p>

                  <hi>There is as ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable a difference between the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt's Perſon, and of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as between the Law and Grace: for the Goſpel of Chriſt is as ſevere a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as the Law, which dooms all men to eternal miſery, who live not very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and virtuous lives; but the Perſon of Chriſt is all Grace, a meer refuge and ſanctuary for the wicked and ungodly, that is,</hi> (as he after explains it) <hi>for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and incorrigible ſinners.</hi>

That the Goſpel is as ſevere a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Law; (which ſurely calls for no leſs than ſinleſs obedience) is untrue in it ſelf; that the Perſon of Chriſt is a refuge for impenitent ſinners; is not ſo much as truly affixed upon the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites; their Writings deny it, their hearts abhor it as prodigious.

                  <hi>and hope in Chriſt are expounded of a fiducial reliance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency on the Perſon of Chriſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in contradiſtinction to obedience to his Laws; which ſets up a Religion of the Perſon of Chriſt, in oppoſition to the Religion of his Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If theſe pregnant Phraſes (of Faith in Chriſt and Hope in Chriſt) do not make him the Object of Faith,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> I know not what can; when the <hi>Socinians</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted among themſelves, whether Chriſt were the Object of Worſhip,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57359:14"/>and ſo of Faith; it was a very hard caſe on the one ſide, that he (according to their Principles) but a meer creature ſhould be the object of faith; on the other, that ſo many pregnant places of Scripture ſhould be eluded; but had they found out a way to interpret ſuch Phraſes (as believing and truſting in him) in a ſence abſtractive from his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they might all have concluded that he was not the object of faith. The Authour, as to a faith of recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency on him and his merits, ſeems to conclude the ſame; for though he ſpeak of truſting in Chriſt and his blood, he interprets himſelf thus, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to be ſaved according to the terms of the Goſpel Covenant, that is, by believing and obeying the Goſpel of Chriſt, pag.</hi> 24. The whole is placed in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and obeying the Goſpel: Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as I take it, is no part of Faith. Works ſhew forth Faith, <hi>James</hi> 2. and ſo are diſtinct from it; Faith produces Obedience, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11. and ſurely it doth not produce it ſelf; <hi>We are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Chriſt,</hi> that is, by Faith, <hi>that we might bring forth fruit unto God,</hi> Rom. 7.1. And me thinks, Faith, which is the eſpouſal, ſhould not be the Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith only is admitted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57359:15"/>in Juſtification, <hi>Romans</hi> 4. And his works (though done after converſion) are excluded, as being no part of it. When <hi>Socinus</hi> ſaid, that, <hi>Chriſto credere idem ſignificat, atque illi obedire:</hi> The Learned <hi>Calovius</hi> tells him; <hi>That it is but a meer Fiction, to prevent the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Juſtification, and transform Faith into Works:</hi> And withall adds, that, <hi>Credere in nullo idiomate idem eſt, quod obedire,</hi> Obedience being no part of Faith; that which remains is only, believing the Goſpel, which is a Dogmatical Faith, ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Goſpel to be true, and <hi>inter alia,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt to be the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> and Saviour. But, alas! This is ſo far beneath a faith of recumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſuch as in the Apoſtle is ſtiled, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57359:15"/>in the wounds of Chriſt, may be only totally lodged in the Evangelical Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om's; I fear that Chriſt will be at odds with the Goſpel; which (contrary to its Native <hi>Genius,</hi> which is to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate faith unto him our Great Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) reſerves all of it to it ſelf. But to go on, the Authour ſaith, <hi>That they are for a recumbency on Chriſt in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to obedience to his Laws, which ſets up a Religion of the Perſon of Chriſt in oppoſition to the Religion of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> I anſwer, They make true faith contradiſtinct from obedience, not that faith is alone in exiſtence, as if it had no holy fruits of obedience hanging, on it, but that it is alone in the matter of Juſtification: And this I think is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Proteſtants, and Fathers. Which made <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> as I have him quoted by the Reverend <hi>Morton,</hi> ſay, <hi>Haec Vox, ſola fides, tot clamoribus lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data hoc ſeculo in</hi> Luthero, <hi>reverentèr le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur &amp; auditur in Patribus;</hi> if faith, though alone in juſtification, do yet ſpread forth it ſelf into holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; I hope the Goſpel is not in the leaſt oppoſed by ſuch a recumbency, as gives Chriſt the glory of his blood and righteouſneſs.

                  <hi>Chriſt is originally the Name of an Office, which the Jews call the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, or Anointed. Jeſus Chriſt was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with the Holy Ghoſt and Power, which was his conſecration to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Function, and virtually contained all thoſe Offices of Prophet, Prieſt, and King, which are not properly diſtinct Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Chriſt, but the ſeveral parts and different adminiſtrations of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Kingdom;</hi> after which, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour deſcribes thoſe Offices to us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> who deny the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt, have ſome reaſon (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their corrupt Principles) to jumble all the Offices of Chriſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the oriency of his Prieſtly Sacrifice might not appear; yet are they caſtigated for it by <hi>Calovius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and <hi>Arnoldus</hi> calls the <hi>Racovian</hi> Catechiſt, <hi>Hoſtis crucis Christi,</hi> upon that account: But why our Authour, who owns the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt, ſhould confound them, I know not; I conceive the Offices of Chriſt are diſtinct, though he, who had them all, performed them in ſuch a juſt <hi>Decorum,</hi> as became him, who had all of them in himſelf: Though he triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Croſs: and what he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was a Law; yet Teaching is not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57359:16"/>Reigning, nor is either Sacrificing: In his Prophetical Office, Salvation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated: in his Prieſtly, purchaſed; in his Kingly, applied: The firſt removes Ignorance, the ſecond expiates Guilt, and the Third ſubdues Corruption. In the Authours deſcription of theſe Offices, the Reader may make ſome Obſervations: In that of the Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office, he mentions his outward preaching, but paſſes over in ſilence that internal illumination of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which to me is the life of the other, without which no man can ſpiritually diſcern the things of God. Hence Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Biſhop <hi>Reynolds,</hi> ſpeaking of the Opinion of <hi>Epiſcopius, that an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man may underſtand ſuch things, ſine lumine ſupernaturali,</hi> is bold to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the ſame as wicked words; In that of the Prieſtly, he tells us; <hi>That Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is the Power of a Regal Prieſt to expiate and forgive ſins:</hi> I take it, Chriſt on Earth had power to forgive ſins, and did expiate them by his once offered Sacrifice on the Croſs. But may we call it Interceſſion? Or, is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion here below? I ever took it to be above, and to be Chriſt's Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Heaven for us, and his preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his meritorious Sacrifice to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57359:17"/>in our behalf. When the <hi>Racovian</hi> Catechiſm deſcribes his Interceſſion by his Power to avert Wrath, <hi>Arnoldus</hi> cenſures it thus, <hi>Quis unquàm tam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epta, ſtolida, inſulſa ſuper claros Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae textus gloſſemata vel ſomniare poſſet? Interpellare Christi in coelis nihil aliud eſſe quam poteſtatem? Quae rei vel ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum ſaltem cognatio?</hi> In that of the Kingly, he ſaith, <hi>That he conquers the minds of men by the Power of his Word and Spirit, and reduces them into Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;</hi> by (Minds) I hope he takes in Wills too, and all is excellent well, may it but ſtand ſo; but afterwards the Authour denies irreſiſtible Grace, and then the Conqueſt is but <hi>ad nutum creaturae,</hi> at the pleaſure of the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the conquered, if he pleaſe, may be Conqueror, and the Conqueror muſt drop his Crown into his Hand: and ſhall we call this a Conqueſt? Or if we may, is it ſuch, as becomes the Throne of the Son of God, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of a Church? After he hath laid the Foundation of his Kingdom in his own blood, muſt he enter precariouſly, and at the Nod of his Subjects? After the Authour hath gathered up all the Offices of Chriſt into his Royalty, and proclaimed him Conqueror over minds
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57359:17"/>and wills, muſt all depend on the will of man? It is a very hard caſe, if any thing could be ſo to the Almighty. Should ſuch a thing be, that of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> muſt fall out, <hi>fallitur Deus,</hi>

                     <hi>to be his peculiar People, he did not deſign to exclude the reſt of the World from his care and Providence, and all poſſible means of Salvation, as the Apoſtle argues, in</hi> Rom. 3.29. Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not alſo of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo: <hi>Which Argument, if it have any force in it, muſt prove Gods reſpect to the Gentiles before the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, as well as ſince; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is founded on that Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation God owns to all Mankind, as their merciful Creator and Governour; which gives the Gentiles as well as Jews an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his Care and Providence: This plainly evinces, that all thoſe particular favours, which God beſtowed on Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, were not owing to any partial fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſpect to that People, but the Deſign of all was, to encourage the

Is he not alſo of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles alſo:</hi> The Apoſtle, in the precedent Verſe, concludes, that the only way of Juſtification is Faith; in this he ſhews, that the one way of Juſtification was open to Gentiles, as well as Jews; in the next Verſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that it is one God who juſtifies both of them in a way of Faith. He ſpeaks not of being the Gentiles God, in reſpect of Care and common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. but in reſpect of extending this way of Juſtification to them, upon their coming in to Chriſt, who was that bleſſed Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whom all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57359:26"/>Nations were to be bleſſed: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till the Goſpel came to them, <hi>they ſate in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death, aliens from Iſrael, ſtrangers from the Covenant, without God, without Chriſt, without hope;</hi> ſeeing no further than Nature, and that deſperately cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and not knowing whether there were any ſuch thing as Grace, or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Center of it. As for Iſrael, I wonder that any man ſhould deny Gods ſpecial Love to that people: What! did he call them <hi>his firſt-born, his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar treaſure, the apple of his eye,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecial Love? Did he <hi>ſever them from other people to be his own,</hi> Levit. 20.21. <hi>chuſe them to himſelf above all people on the earth; ſet his love upon them, and that merely becauſe he loved them,</hi> Deut. 7.6, 7, and 8.

Were <hi>theirs the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes,</hi> Rom. 9.4. and all this without ſpecial Love? <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with any nation,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Jews knew God to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> very true, but through the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom the Believers among them ſaw ſlain in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57359:34"/>every Sacrifice; or elſe, which is hard to believe, they knew not the meaning of that Service, or did it not in Faith. The Gentiles, as I conceive, had ſome Glimmerings of pardoning Mercy in his Patience towards them, ſparing Mercy being an hint of pardoning; but this Patience was founded on the Sacrifice of Chriſt, though unknown to them. God upon the Fall of Angels made a ſhort work, and immediately caſt them down into Chains; and that he did not ſo with Men, is only owing to the Sacrifice of Chriſt. As for the Dr. I ſuppoſe, as to the Jews, he will fully concurr with me; and as to the Gentiles, I muſt concurr with him, for he ſaith, pag. 91. <hi>That pardoning Mercy which is reveiled in the Goſpel, ſhines not with one Ray out of Chriſt; the Mercy in the Goſpel expreſly relates to the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, and as ſuch they knew it not; though that Patience, which gave ſome glimpſe of it, was founded on that Satisfaction.</hi>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57359:35"/>is ſo juſt, that he cannot pardon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Satisfaction. <hi>Now this is ſuch a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice as is perfectly new, which neither Scripture nor Nature acquaints us with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perfectly new!<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> how ſo? How many grave Divines and worthy Champions againſt the Socinians have affirmed, That God, ſuch is his infinite Sanctity and Righteouſneſs, cannot pardon ſin without a Recompence or Satisfaction? And how ſtrongly have they urged it out of Scripture and Reaſon! In Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God is ſet forth as a Righteous God, a Judge of the World, who will do right; one who cannot look upon iniquity, who will by no means clear the guily; his puniſhing ſin is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not meerly to his Will or Decree, but to his juſt Nature. Thus the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Tempeſt comes down upon the wicked, <hi>becauſe the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 11.6, 7. Thus <hi>the vials of wrath are poured out, becauſe God is righteouſneſs,</hi> Revel. 16.5. In God an hatred of Sin is as eſſential as a love of Holineſs; and in this hatred is tacitly included a <hi>velle punire,</hi> as ſome Divines ſpeak; and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſin cannot go unpuniſhed. The Subjection of a Rational Creature to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57359:35"/>its Creator is indiſpenſable, and this Dependence, ſo far as it is broken off by ſin, muſt be ſalved up by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Should God puniſh meerly from his Will, then it ſeems, Sin or no Sin, is all one to him. God is in his own Nature no more moved with Impieties and helliſh Blaſphemies, than if there were none; the puniſhing them or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving them is but an indifferent thing. <hi>Socinus</hi> upon that Text, <hi>abſolvendo non abſolvet,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That God, as propenſe as he is to mercy and forgiveneſs, abſolves no rebels and impenitent perſons remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that eſtate:</hi> Yet, if he might pardon without a Satisfaction, might he not do it without Repentance alſo? The very Pagans knew <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the juſt judgment of God,</hi> or that he would puniſh ſin; and this not from the reveiled Will of God, but from the natural Principles and Sculptures graven in their hearts; which ſhews that the puniſhment is not meerly from God's Will. If Sin could have been pardoned without Satisfaction, why was the only beloved Son of God made a Curſe? Why did he fear, and tremble, and bow, and ſweat, and pray, and die upon a Croſs, as the Dr. patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally expreſſes his Paſſion? It ſeems all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57359:36"/>this might have been ſpared. But ſaith the Author, <hi>All Mankind hath accounted it an act of goodneſs to remit injuries, without exacting puniſhment; and he is ſo far from being just, that he is cruel and ſavage, who will remit no offence, till he hath ſatisfied his revenge: That part of Justice, which conſiſts in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offenders, was always look'd on as an inſtrument of Government; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the exacting or remitting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was referred to the wiſdom of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, who might ſpare or puniſh as they ſaw reaſon for it.</hi> Unto which I anſwer, The Compariſon between God and Man holds not in all things: A Man may renounce his Dominion over his Servant, but God cannot renounce his Dominion over his Creature; that, whileſt a Creature, muſt be ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. <hi>A man</hi> (ſaith the Author) <hi>is cruel, who will remit no offence till he hath ſatisfied his revenge:</hi> But, I hope, God is not ſo, who never did, hath or will remit any the leaſt offence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſatisfaction; a man may remit a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate offence without it, but may a Magiſtrate remit a publick one in all caſes? No, ſurely, ſometimes Juſtice and the Common Good calls for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; <hi>Deus non vult, ut Princeps
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57359:36"/>ſcelerato Legum publicarum violatori poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam commeritam remittat,</hi> ſaith the Learned <hi>Camero:</hi> God is here conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Magiſtrate, as the great Judge of the World, and that he cannot remit without ſatisfaction, is not out of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, or Cruelty, but becauſe of the ſupreme Perfection of his Juſtice and Sanctity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After the terrible diſcovery of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalneſs of God's Juſtice,</hi>

                     <hi>the Doctor makes ſome amends for it; for now in Chriſt, the Nature of God is diſcovered to be love and kindneſs; a happy change this, from all Juſtice to all Love! But how comes this to paſs? why, the account is very plain, becauſe the Juſtice of God hath glutted it ſelf with revenge on ſin, in the Death of Chriſt:</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>God is Love and Patience, when he hath taken his fill of revenge, as others uſe to ſay, that the Devil is very good, when he is pleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What!<note place="margin">Anſwer</note> doth God glut himſelf with Revenge? or is he, as the Devil good when he is pleaſed? I tremble at the Expreſſions, and verily believe, that the Dr. would have laid down his neck upon the Block before he would have uttered them. Revenge or Vengeance in God is nothing but pure immaculate
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57359:37"/>Juſtice: Glutting with Revenge is an Expreſſion fit for malicious Men, or for Devils rather, but not at all for God: God out of Chriſt is a conſuming Fire, but in Chriſt a gracious Father, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the World unto himſelf. Not that there is a change in the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able One; but, according to his wiſe and gracious Decree, his Juſtice was ſatisfied in Chriſt, and through that Satisfaction his Love and Kindneſs ſweetly ſtream out to Men: He that dares deny this muſt forfeit his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. But if the Dr. did not utter theſe horrid words, may any ſuch thing be drawn from him by conſequence? This the Author would hint; for ſaith he, <hi>The Dr. ſpeaks very honourably of God; Whatever, ſaith the Dr. diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were made of the Patience and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of God unto us, yet if it were not withal reveiled, that the other Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God, as his Juſtice and Revenge for ſin, had their actings aſſigned them to the full, there could be little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilation gathered from the former; That is,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God himſelf, though he ſhould make never ſo many Promiſes of Grace to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, unleſs he were ſure, that he had first ſatisfied his revenge.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57359:37"/>Doth the Dr. by [Diſcoveries] intend Promiſes of Graces? No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly: In his very entrance into the Diſcourſe of Patience, he tells us his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove, <hi>That the Glimpſes of Patience ſhining out in works of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are exceedingly beneath the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it which we have in Chriſt;</hi> and both before and after the words quoted, he gives Inſtances of Gods Goodneſs in the Rain &amp; fruitful ſeaſons, &amp; he ſhews what kind of Patience he intends, that is, <hi>A not immediate puniſhing upon the offence,</hi> not a word or tittle of Promiſes: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it at all imaginable that he could mean them; for he, who holds a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Satisfaction, as the Dr. doth, could not ſo much as think one ſingle thought of a Promiſe to be the object of his Faith, or indeed at all to be, without a crucified Chriſt, in whom God's Juſtice was ſatisfied. And for the Glimpſes of Patience ſhining out in Works of Providence, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon even to the poor Pagans, I may well ſay, that they are little, very little conſolations in compariſon of thoſe which Chriſtians have: Pagans may ſee God forbearing, but Chriſtians ſee him fully ſatisfied in the Blood of Chriſt: Pagans ſee God forbearing, but they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57359:38"/>cannot tell how long he may do ſo, or how ſoon his wrath may come daſhing down upon them; but Chriſtians know that they are delivered from the wrath to come, and ſo God's Patience is very ſweet to them. But the Author goes on in his charge: <hi>The Doctor ſaith, that the nature and end of God's Patience and Forbearance, is, God's taking a courſe in his infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, that we ſhould not be deſtroyed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our ſins; the Justice of God being ſatisfied, the greateſt ſins can do us no hurt, we ſhall eſcape notwithstanding our ſins: But the Goſpel inſtructs us, That without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God:</hi> Thus the Author. To which I anſwer. Surely we ſhall eſcape notwithſtanding our ſins, or elſe we cannot eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pure ſinleſs perfection, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our greateſt ſins, or elſe they exceed Gods Mercy and Chriſt's Merit: But what, without Repentance and Holineſs? No, by no means, the Doctor means no ſuch matter, but ſaith expreſly, <hi>That the end of Gods patience is, that his Will concerning our Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Salvation may be accompliſhed,</hi> and quotes that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>God is long-ſuffering to us ward, not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that any ſhould periſh, but that all
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57359:38"/>ſhould come to repentance;</hi> and ſurely where true Repentance is, holineſs of Life will follow.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57359:41"/>no occaſion for puniſhing, than be made glorious by ſuch acts of vengeance: Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Juſtice and pardoning Mercy are but ſecondary Attributes of the Divine Nature, and therefore God cannot prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily deſign the glorifying of them; for that cannot be without deſigning the ſin and miſery of his Creatures, which would be inconſiſtent with the goodneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Nature.</hi> And afterwards <hi>pag.</hi> 57. <hi>He appointed ſin for the glory of his Juſtice and Grace, and (ſince nothing can withſtand the Decrees of God) it pleaſed God that Man ſhould ſin, but when he hath ſinned, he is extremely diſpleaſed with it, and now his Justice muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: This falls hard on thoſe miſerable Wretches, whoſe ill fortune it was, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fault of theirs, to be left out of the Roll of Election, and who have no way to ſatisfie divine Juſtice, but by their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal torments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is, I ſuppoſe, agreed by all, that God did willingly permit the entry of ſin upon the World of Angels and Men: he could have kept all the Angels up in their primitive Station, and then there would have been no Tempter to Man; or, had their been one, he could have ſent the holy Angels to warn him from the late downcaſt of their fellows, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57359:42"/>his own, and to tell him, that the poyſon would come from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; or, if not that, he could have ſent him ſuch ſtrong auxiliaries of Grace as ſhould have out wreſtled the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he could, no doubt, as eaſily as he confirms the Saints and Angels in Heaven; he could for ever have barr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out ſin, but he would not, he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered it to come in, only the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, How he did it? Whether there be only a nude Permiſſion, ſuch as leaves the event pendulous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, till Man's Will hath determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or whether there be a Preordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Event, ſo that it falls out infallibly, <hi>Deo permittente</hi> and <hi>Creatura liberè agente?</hi> Two things conſtrain me to believe the latter: The one is this, That without a Preordination, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of ſinful Actions muſt be caſual, and what then ſhall become of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? The Moments, which hang upon thoſe Events, are great and weighty. Multitudes of Angels, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of Heaven, turn Apoſtates; out of their Fall comes a Tempter, who at one blow draws Man and all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into ſin; that entring into the world makes way for a glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt: The Four firſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57359:42"/>Monarchies rowl about upon the Luſts and Ambitions of Men; The poor Church, like the Ark, floats upon the waters, and now and then a ſtorm of perſecution comes daſhing down upon it; Errors and Hereſies ſucceſſively break forth as ſo many Torrents ready to carry away every Article of our Creed, and what mighty Concerns are theſe? Admirable are the Methods and Myſteries of Providence in and about ſuch Events; <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren ſell him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Church is provided for in the famine; <hi>Abſolon</hi> goes in to his Fathers Concubines,, and <hi>David</hi> is viſited for his Adultery; <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Tamar</hi> commit Inceſt, and this way came the holy One into the fleſh; The wicked Jews crucifie the Son of God, and out comes the great Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; Perſecutors ſcatter the Church, and God by this means ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. In ſuch Actions as theſe the Light ſhines out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; God's Mercy, Juſtice, Wiſdom, Holineſs, Power, break forth out of Man's Cruelty, Injuſtice, Folly, Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Weakneſs: In every Ataxy God hath a ſecret Order; either an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Penalty, Sin puniſhing Sin; or an Order of Conducibility, Good
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57359:43"/>coming out of Evil. <hi>Nullum eſt malum in mundo</hi> (ſaith profound <hi>Bradwardine</hi>) <hi>quod non eſt propter aliquod magnum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, &amp; forſitan propter aliquod majus bonum.</hi> The Concerns being ſo great, ſit down and conſider; May ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents be caſual? Did Angels and Man fall by chance, or could that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is waky over Hairs and Sparrows, ſleep over ſuch a Concern? Or if it could, muſt not the great work of Redemption, pendent on a caſual Fall, be caſual alſo? May Fortune ring the changes over Empires and Churches, or caſt out Perſecutions and Hereſies, as roving Meteors to do her pleaſure? May lots be caſt upon the Genealogy and Paſſion of Chriſt, or the Acts of Gods Mercy, Juſtice, Wiſdom, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Power ſhining out in ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents hang upon a Peradventure? May the All-wiſe and Almighty God ſit, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatis manibus &amp; oculis conniventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> as <hi>Amyraldus</hi> ſpeaks, whileſt ſuch vaſt and wonderful Concerns are in agitation? Methinks no ſober Man can in Reaſon think it credible. For my own part, did I once believe a Lottery of ſuch Events, I ſhould think that my next Fancy would be, That <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Atoms by a lucky Hit made up that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57359:43"/>World, which is ſo fortuitouſly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in the very great Concerns of it: He that allows not a determining ſtroke of Providence in ſuch things, <hi>May,</hi> as Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> ſaith, <hi>avoid the ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Stoiciſm or Manicheiſm, but very hardly of Atheiſm.</hi> This is the firſt thing: Theſe Events, if unordained, muſt needs be caſual, and without a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Neither is this to be ſalved by Divine Preſcience; Preſcience, as it is infallible, is of things future and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Verity; and caſual unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Events, not being ſuch, are no fit Object for it: This made <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> doubt, <hi>whether Preſcience or at leaſt the knowledge of it were neceſſary.</hi> But might ſuch a thing be of meer Caſuals, yet Preſcience is not Providence. Had the Epicurean Atoms rallied themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a World, the Event, though fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, could not have been claimed by Providence as its own, but muſt have been left to thoſe Ethnick Names of Chance or Fortune; and to the ſame, muſt every unordained Event be left, over which there is nothing but meer Preſcience. The other thing, which conſtrains my Belief, is, That the holy Scripture, from whence we muſt take our trueſt Meaſures, expreſly, empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57359:44"/>own ſuch a Preordination of the Event; not to inſiſt on that Counſel of <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> which yet obſervably hits the Mark, only as God will have it, to chaſtiſe <hi>David</hi> in the Concubines, but not to deſtroy him in the purſuit; I ſhall inſtance in others; <hi>God turned his heart to hate his people,</hi> Pſal. 105.25. <hi>God put it into their hearts to give their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unto the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 17.17. <hi>It was of the Lord to harden their hearts,</hi> Joſh. 11.20. <hi>The cauſe was from the Lord, that Rehoboam hearkened not,</hi> 1 Kings 12.15.

And in truth, what elſe can they do in ſuch caſes? May they fear, truſt in, or depend on Man? He is but a Creature, and there is a Curſe in it: Shall they fear, truſt in, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon God? A God he is, but ſuch Events fall not under his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In a word; Theſe things give me ſuch ſatisfaction in this Point, that if Humane Reaſon could object what I could not anſwer, I ſhould yet adhere to the Truth, ſaying with St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Petrus <hi>negat, Latro credit, O altitudo! quaeris tu rationem, ego expaveſcam al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem; tu diſputa, ego credam.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall conſider what the Author ſaith; and firſt he tells us, <hi>That ſuch an ordaining is not conſistent with Gods Holineſs:</hi> To which I anſwer, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this Objection in the Remonſtrants
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57359:45"/>look'd to me, <hi>primâ facie,</hi> as a piece of Tenderneſs towards God, leſt any blot ſhould light on the holy One; they frame God's Decrees upon Preſcience, and ſuffer Man's Will to go formoſt in the Event of ſinful Acts: But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, that even in the Event of good Actions, they frame Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees upon Preſcience alſo, and let Man's Will take the Primacy, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me, that the great Center of all was no other than the Will of Man; and from ſuch a Center, I deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that any Divine Attribute ſhould be truly glorified. Indeed, after the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath ſo often and pregnantly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted a determining Providence over ſuch Events, for man to ſay, <hi>That God is holier than ſo,</hi> is a piece of fondneſs like that of the <hi>Maſoreths,</hi> who in the Hebrew Bible have put in ſome words in the Margin, as cleanlier than thoſe in the Text: Nothing can be vainer than to imagine that Man ſhould be able to draw the Picture of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs fairer than he himſelf hath done in Scripture; or that what is ſpoken there touching his Providence, ſhould in the leaſt reflect upon his Holineſs. But for a fuller Anſwer, I ſay, Gods Providence, which in ſinful Actions, is, as I take it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57359:45"/>of the Entity, permiſſive of the Malice, diſpoſitive of the Order, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinative of the Event, doth in none of theſe caſt any blot on his Holineſs. As to the Entity, God acts but as becomes the Firſt Cauſe; <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf would have it, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t totus act us ritè Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiae ſubjiciatur, quà actus efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, quà peccatum permittenti Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</hi> As to the Malice, God is but a Permiſſor: Sin in the abſtract hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a deficient Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Creature, that, as defectible in it ſelf, hath <hi>redire ad non eſſe à ſel,</hi> and, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Law diſtinct from it ſelf, may fall ſhort of it: But God, who hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law but his own Perfection, and can no more decline from his Rectitude than his Being, is a meer Permiſſor. As to the Order, God diſpoſes it; here inſtead of a Blot, the Glory of God breaks forth, in that he hath his holy Line in the midſt of the Ataxies of men; either an Order of Penalty, ſuch as becomes him as the <hi>Prima Justitia;</hi> or an Order of Coducibility, ſuch as ſutes him as the <hi>Prima Sapientia.</hi> In the Sale of <hi>Joſeph</hi> Man was cruel, but God merciful: In the Act of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Tamar,</hi> Man was unclean, but God holy, aiming at the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in it: In
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57359:46"/>
                     <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s rough Anſwer, Man was fooliſh, but God wiſe, to accompliſh his word: In the Aſſyrian Tyranny, Man was unjuſt, but God righteous to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his people: In the ſtrong Deluſions ſent to thoſe that love not the Truth, Man was weak, but God ſtrong in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Judgements; and, to name but one more: In the Crucifixion of Chriſt, there was Malice, Blood and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on Man's part, but Love, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs on God's; one At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute or other of his glitters in the Event, with no more taint than is upon the pure Sun-beams by their converſe in unclean places. It's true, God needs not Sin to recommend his Glory, no, nor Virtue or Holineſs in the Creature; but ſure he uſes Sin that way, and that ſo holily, that it deſerves a more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Expreſſion than <hi>trucking with ſin and the Devil.</hi> As to the Event God preordains it.

Having ſo prolixly ſpoken of the Ordination of ſuch Events, a very little may ſerve as to the End; when God preordains ſuch Events, to be ſure he doth it in great Wiſdom and Reaſon, ſome End there is in it: If any will ſay, it was done, <hi>quià Voluit,</hi> I am content, his Will is never irrational; if he will ſay further, that it was for his Glory, I am ſatisfied, that is the ſupreme End; if he will yet go on and ſay, it was for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Juſtice and Mercy, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57359:48"/>tell how to aſſign a better End; if the after-uſe made of Sin may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret God's meaning, that ſhews forth the Illuſtration of both thoſe Attributes: The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That God is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew his wrath and power in ſome, and to make known the riches of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in others,</hi> Rom. 9. Suppoſe there were no Ordination, but only a nude Permiſſion, a man may ask, Why did God permit ſuch an <hi>Apollyon</hi> as Sin to enter the World? Why ſuffered he ſo many glorious Angels to fall into ſin, and immediately, without any place for Repentance, to ſink into Chains of Darkneſs for ever? There is ſcarce any appearance but of meer Sovereignty &amp; Juſtice in it: Why ſuffered he Man and all his Poſterity with him to fall into ſin and wrath? It is plain, that the work of Redemption, in which Juſtice and Mercy were both ſhewed forth, was uſhered in upon it. It's true, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That God delights not in the death of a ſinner;</hi> not in death, as it is the miſery of the Creatute; not in the death of a repenting ſinner, his Repentance, which is there oppoſed to Death, is more grateful: However, the ſins of men fall under his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and, without repentance, their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57359:48"/>death, as an act of Juſtice, wil be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, inſomuch that he will laugh at it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. There are behind yet two other Expreſſions; the one puts the Doctor's Opinion into odious colours, after this manner: <hi>It pleaſed God that Man ſhould ſin, but when he had ſinned, he is exceedingly diſpleaſed at it:</hi> But upon the very opening of it, all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes into nothing; God's holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was his pleaſure, but Man's Sin is hateful and provocative of wrath. This cannot be ſtrange to any one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Scripture: The Aſſyrian Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was the Staff and the Rod in Gods hand, ſent by him againſt his people; yet when the work was done, God would puniſh the fruit of his ſtout heart, and kindle a fire under his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Gods Hand and Gods Counſel was in the Crucifixion of Chriſt, and yet what an horrible tempeſt of wrath came down on the Jews for it? The other Expreſſion is this; <hi>This falls hard upon thoſe miſerable wretches, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fault of theirs were left out of the Roll of Election:</hi> To which I anſwer; It is very hard if God may not have his Royal Prerogative of putting in or leaving out whom he pleaſes in the Book of Life; the Apoſtle is clear, <hi>He
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57359:49"/>will have mercy on whom he will, &amp; whom he will he hardens,</hi> Rom. 9. And if any murmur he muſt hear, <hi>Nay, but, O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God?</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid. If thou hadſt, O Man, but any Sentiments of thy own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs, or true Rayes of the divine Glory, thou wouldſt never dare to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead thy Maker: Thou wouldſt not endure to ſee a little Fly or Ant, had it Reaſon enough, to draw an Earthly Prince into queſtion, and wilt thou do ſo to the great Lord of Heaven and Earth?

                     <hi>ſaid the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> that we are not guilty, we muſt alſo be actually righteous; not only all ſin is to be anſwered for, but all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is to be fulfilled: Now this Righteouſneſs we find only in Chriſt, we are reconciled to God by his Death and ſaved by his Life; that actual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience he yielded to the whole Law of God is that Righteouſneſs whereby we are ſaved; we are innocent by virtue of his Expiation, and righteous with his Righteouſneſs. Upon which words the Author infers; <hi>This is a mighty comfortable diſcovery, how we may be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57359:49"/>righteous without doing any thing that is good or righteous; but the Goſpel tells us that he is righteous who doth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; that without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God; that the only way to obtain pardon of ſins, is to repent of and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them: The only thing that gives a right to the promiſes of future Glory is to obey the Laws and imitate the Example of our Saviour, and to be transformed into the Nature and likeneſs of God.</hi>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57359:51"/>of agreement, or upon that, of walking together; nothing can be more remote than this frame from ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: The foundation then of this is laid in Chriſt, he is our peace, he ſlew the Enmity in his Body on the Croſs, he made an atonement with God; God lays down the Enmity on his part, and proceeds to ſlay the Enmity on ours: We receive the Atonement, lay down our Enmity to God, and have acceſs unto the Father: Christ gives us an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding to know him that is true; he conſecrates a new and a living way into the holiest of all; and this way is no other but himſelf, he is the Medium of communication between God and us; all influences of Love, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Mercy from God to us are through him; all our returns of Love, Delight, Obedience to God, are all through him; nay, all our Strength is from him, by the Spirit of life and power he bears us on Eagles Wings in the paths of walking with God; and in him we come to have an aim and deſign at Gods Glory.</hi> Thus and much more ſaith the Dr. in that place, his excellent words need no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology; let the curious Palate taſte them at the Fountain, and then tell me, if there be any Tack or Tincture of thoſe black Conſequences hinted by

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57359:56"/>and filthineſs allowed, but how untrue is this? Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>Thou canst not come to Christ, till thou art loaden, and ſeparated from thy ſins; thou canſt not be ingraffed into this Olive, unleſs thou beest cut off from thy old root; thou must be made willing, or rather not unwilling, that the Lord ſhould take away thy ſin:</hi> To come weary and ſick, and naked to Chriſt, is not to come indulging our ſins, but groaning under them; if there be no wants or ſence of them, how or why ſhould we come to Chriſt? Should we come to him, to ſhew him the garments which nature made, the innate or acquiſite vertue, and excellency which is in us? Should we open our treaſures, and tell him that we are rich, and increaſed in Goods, and have need of nothing? this is the way to be ſpued out of his mouth: The Philoſopher being asked, what God was a doing, could ſay, that he was buſie <hi>in elevatione humilium, &amp; ſuperborum dejectione:</hi> We muſt go to Chriſt weary and heavy laden under our ſins, but ſurely not ſtrip'd of them altogether; could we ſtrip off the guilt and power of theſe without Chriſt, we might be our own Saviours and Sanctiſiers, Chriſt would have little or

Then we muſt utterly evacuate theſe promiſes; for they muſt run thus, if we will perſevere, we ſhall perſevere, and ſo much was true under the old Covenant, and without any promiſe at all: Mr. <hi>Watſon</hi> argues thus, <hi>If any branch be plucked away from Chriſt, it is either becauſe Chriſt is not able to keep it, or becauſe he is willing to loſe it:</hi> But ſaith the Author, <hi>May not ſin diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the union?

Hath he not power to ſtrengthen believers, in that which is good, or if they lapſe, to raiſe them up again? If ſo, his promiſe cannot fail, his faithfulneſs will make it good; neither doth ſin committed, un-ſaint a believer, as the Author hints; this was the remarkable difference between the two Covenants; in <hi>Adam</hi> one ſin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled

                  <p>I ſuppoſe they cannot loath diſcourſes of duty;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> For as our Author tells us a little after, they make Obedience to Chriſt their husband, a conjugal act, and in order to that they muſt hear of duty; Only I take it, they had rather hear duty ſpread before them, in a plain Scriptural dreſs, than in curious ſpeculations of meer humane reaſon: They would have duty inculcated, but not ſo perpetually, as to exclude the preaching up of that Divine Grace which enables thereunto, without this they deſpair of doing any thing aright; but ſaith the Author, <hi>It is very hard to find a proper place for Obedience in this new Religion; for this is not neceſſary at all, to our coming to Chriſt, and cloſing with him; nay, it is a great hinderance to it, for we muſt bring nothing to Chriſt with us, the marriage is conſummated without it, and then we have leſs need of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57359:60"/>it than before, for then we are adorned with Chriſts Beauty, holy with his holineſs, delivered by his expiation, righteous with his righteouſneſs, which gives us an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al right to Glory; we need no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own to ſave us, which were to ſuppoſe a defect in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt;</hi> unto which I anſwer, Though a man, with his arms of rebellion in his hands, cannot poſſibly, whileſt in that poſture, cloſe with Chriſt; yet I take it, Faith, which eſpouſes Chriſt, doth precede true Obedience: <hi>Without faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>Without ſaith,</hi> ſaith our Church in the Homily of good works, <hi>All that is done of us is but dead before God, although the work ſeem never ſo gay and glorious before man, even as the picture graven or painted, is but a dead repreſentation of the thing it ſelf, ſo be the works of all unfaithful perſons before God, they do appear to be lively works, and indeed they be but dead, not availing to the everlasting life; they be but ſhadows and ſhews of lively and good things, and not good and lively things indeed,</hi> thus our Church excellently; which tells us what manner of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we can bring to Chriſt: After our eſpouſals to Chriſt by faith, Obedience
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57359:60"/>follows as a fruit and effect of Faith; though the Author faſten this opinion expreſly on thoſe whom he oppoſes, calling them in ſport, <hi>intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of Chriſt;</hi> yet our Church tells us in the twelfth Article, <hi>That good works do ſpring neceſſarily out of a true and lively Faith:</hi> Chriſts righteouſneſs makes us righteous in Juſtification, but doth it thence follow, that Obedience is needleſs? No ſure. It is a thing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Papiſts, that they confound Juſtification and Sanctification toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but we muſt not do ſo, if it be neceſſary to do Gods will, or promote his Glory, or to give evidences of our Faith in, and gratitude to Chriſt; or to walk in the way to Heaven and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then ſuch is Obedience; but the Author cannot underſtand this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>unleſs our Righteouſneſs and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be due to Chriſt in thankfulneſs to him for ſaving us without Obedience and Righteouſneſs, which is juſt as broad, as long, and we get nothing by the bargain:</hi> To which I anſwer, our Obedience is a due gratitude to Chriſt, who ſaves us by his Blood and Righteouſneſs, and and that without a perfect, perſonal, ſinleſs Obedience in our ſelves; and withal, it is neceſſary as a proof of our

                     <hi>without obeying of thee:</hi> Is this the Doctors meaning? Do his words import ſo?

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57359:61"/>Its true, the Author calls this <hi>a pretty complement,</hi> but the Doctor ſpeaks it as his ſerious judgment: In the eighth Chapter of the book quoted, he tells us, <hi>Obedience is indiſpenſibly neceſſary, if Gods Sovereignty is to be owned, if his Love to be regarded, if the whole work of the ever bleſſed Trinity for us, in us, be of any moment, our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is neceſſary:</hi> Thus fully the Doctor, who yet is here conſtrued by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to exclude Obedience; what meaſure this is let others judge.</p>

                  <p>They learn from Chriſt's Perſon,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> but what, without the Goſpel? No, by no means; without this, they cannot, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to know, whether there be ſuch a Perſon as Chriſt or no, or what are the Ends of his Incarnation, Life, Death and Reſurrection: Theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon God's appointment, and that is ſet forth in the Goſpel: But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Goſpel as an outward <hi>Medium,</hi> they ſee Chriſt and many Myſteries in him, who is the Mirrour of divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and the great Illuminator by his Spirit. But, ſaith the Author, <hi>they (ſuch is their intolerable preſumption) ſhape Religion according to their Fancies, and ſtuff it with an infinite number of Orthodox Propoſitions; none of which are to be found in expreſs Terms in Scripture,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57359:63"/>but are pretended to be deduced from thence by ſuch imaginary conſequences, from ſome little hints of things; and is not this unpardonable in thoſe men, who cry down Reaſon as a prophane and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thing, and yet lay the Foundation of their Religion on ſome little ſhews and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Reaſon?</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The harſh Cenſure of <hi>Eccius</hi> made <hi>

                     <hi>that this heavenly Ambaſſador and Mediator is no leſs than the Son of God, by whom the Worlds were made, we may reaſonably conclude, that he came upon no leſs Deſign than of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Goodneſs; for he can have no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Partiality, as being equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Happineſs of all men; and we cannot imagine, why he ſhould lay a narrower deſign of Love in the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than in the Creation of Mankind: When in the firſt Creation he deſigned all for Happineſs, that in this new and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Creation he ſhould deſign only the Happineſs of ſome few, is to make him leſs good in Redeeming, than in Creating Mankind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt in his Coming and ſatisfactory Sufferings had a reſpect to all Men,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> ſo far as to procure for them Salvation on Goſpel-terms, but he had not an equal reſpect to all; it being utterly unima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57359:64"/>that he ſhould have as great a reſpect to thoſe in the Pagan World, who have no Chriſt, no atoning Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, no Promiſe of Life and Salvation revealed to them, as he hath to thoſe in the Church, who have all theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Objects evidently ſet ſorth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: Greater Donations argue greater degrees of Love; or elſe, which is very hard to believe, God loves all Creatures alike, notwithſtaneing that he meaſures out his Goodneſs to them in a very various and different manner, to ſome more, and to others leſs. But becauſe the Author hath before laid down a good Rule, <hi>That the Virtue and Efficacy of Chriſt's Death doth depend on God's Institution and Appointment, and therefore can be known only by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I ſhall apply my ſelf only to the Scripture: There, as we find, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he might gather together the Children of God that were ſcatered, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.52. <hi>He gave himſelf for his Church, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it,</hi> Eph. 5.26. <hi>He gave himſelf that he might purifie to himſelf a peculiar people,</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>He laid down his life for his ſheep, ſo as to bring them into his fold and make them hear his voice,</hi> Joh. 10.15, 16. <hi>He redeems ſome from among
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57359:65"/>men,</hi> Rev. 14.4. And <hi>out of every kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and tongue, and people, and nation,</hi> Rev. 5.9. All which Scriptures do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically ſhew, that Chriſt had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reſpect in his Death unto his own above others. But further; Chriſt by his precious Blood founded thoſe Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Promiſes, of taking away the ſtony Heart, writing the Law in the Heart, and putting his holy Spirit there; but did he found them for all men? What, for thoſe <hi>whom God will harden,</hi> Rom. 9? What, for thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, who have not ſo much as the Law before them in the Letter, nor that Goſpel which is <hi>Vehiculum Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tûs ſancti?</hi> How, or which way, or by what means can ſuch Promiſes be made good to them? How ſhall they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate without the holy Spirit, or have that without the Goſpel? It is not at all credible; ſuch ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the Covenant founded by his Blood, ſpeak a ſpecial reſpect to his own Elect. The Author's Reaſon from Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation cannot hold good: The lapſed Angels had their ſhare of Goodneſs in Creation, but none at all in Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: God, who is the Great Donor of his Son to the World, may give him with what Reſpects and to what Intents
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57359:65"/>he pleaſes; and, if he have ſpecial pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in it, no man may preſume to ſay, that he is partial or leſs good then he ought to be.</p>

                  <p>God's Decree of Reprobation may be taken two ways;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> either for an Act of Preterition, not giving men ſaving Grace, but leaving them to final Sin; or for a Decree of Damnation: In this latter God looks on Men as final Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and reveils his Juſtice in their Condemnation: In the former he doth not look on men as final Sinners, but paſs them by and leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to become ſuch; and in this he ſhews forth his infinite Sovereignty in diſpenſing Grace as he pleaſeth.</p>

No Chriſtian ears will endure ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; however, God having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in thoſe ways, as the Author im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; why did not thoſe plots take effect, and ſave Chriſt the labour of coming in the fleſh? May it become his infinite wiſdom to attempt this and that, and at laſt light upon the right way? Or may it comport with his infinite power to be poſed and nonpluſt, and that in ſo great a concern, as Man's recovery?

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57359:66"/>what might it be? Was it for want of a ſatisfaction? No, according to our Author that was not neceſſary, God might have pardoned without it; or was it becauſe the corrupt obſtinate Will of man did fruſtrate thoſe deſigns? Very well, after that laſt greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign by Chriſt, may it not do the ſame? According to our Author, God as paſſionately deſirous, and reſtleſly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as he is in this matter, affords yet no higher than ſuaſory reſiſtible Grace; and let any judge, how reconcileable ſuch opinions are with infinite wiſdom or power, or indeed with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which tells us, <hi>That he doth whatſoever he pleaſes:</hi> Pſal. 115.3. It's true, the great <hi>Grotius</hi> gloſſes on that place thus, <hi>Ideò homo libertatem habet, quia Deus voluit,</hi> which is true within the Text; but if that liberty be of ſo vaſt a latitude, that it may fruſtrate ſo great a deſign, as that of Salvation by Chriſt, the truth of the Text cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conſiſt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I conceive that Chriſt expiated our ſins upon the Croſs,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> but that expiation
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57359:67"/>avails us not, till it be applied by faith; <hi>He gave himſelf a ranſom for all.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.6.

                  <p>Certainly it is very ſad,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> ſaith a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Divine, <hi>That ſcoffing at the doctrines of repentance and humiliation, which was wont to be a badge of prophaneſs,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57359:67"/>ſhould be adopted into religion:</hi> The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells us a little before, <hi>Chriſt and his appearance were not deſigned to cauſe tempeſts and earthquakes in our minds; without ſuch artificial methods of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>our lives may be reformed, and minds rectified;</hi> but what ſaith the Scripture? Our Saviour preached up repentance. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of a ſpirit of bondage, going before the ſpirit of Adoption. S. <hi>James</hi> would have ſinners be afflicted, and mourn, and weep, and to turn their laughter into mourning, and their joy to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, and to humble themſelves in the ſight of the Lord, that they may be lifted up: And what ſaith Reaſon? Sin of all things in the world, calls for ſorrow, ſorrow was made for ſin, if for any thing at all; ſin is ſo intimately in us, that it will not eaſily come out, being contracted with joy, it muſt be diſſolved with ſorrow: The hard heart, unleſs melted by the fiery Law, will not run into the Goſpel-mould; nor will the proud heart, unleſs bowed down under the weight of ſin and wrath, ever ſtoop under the Divine command; the new creature is not born without pangs, nor the inward Circumciſion, which cuts off the dear,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57359:68"/>but corrupt fleſh of the heart, done without ſome anguiſh; ſelf-judging uſhers in juſtification before God, and deſpair in our ſelves a lively hope in our Saviour: On all hands we are ſummoned to methods of repentance; the groaning Creation ſhames us into that poſture, and the indwelling ſin preſſes us into it; the broken Law calls for a broken heart, and the ſtorm of wrath black in the threatning, for a trembling one; a crucified Chriſt asks a mourning eye, and an exalted one gives it: Why the Author ſhould call theſe penitential acts, artifices, or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ignorance, or think them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary or improper, under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, I ſee no juſt reaſon at all for it.</p>

                     <hi>and therefore Faith, which is the Instrument of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, is very luckily called, Coming to Christ: But this is not enough, we must receive Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1.12. <hi>that Faith which ſerves us for Legs to go to Chriſt, muſt be an Hand to receive him; when we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, we muſt embrace him in our Arms, as old</hi> Simeon <hi>did, when he found him in the Temple, which is a little near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, as plainly appears from the example of the Patriarchs, who embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Promiſes: And now we have Chriſt, we muſt truſt and lean upon him, as we are often commanded; and, if lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be not enough, we may make a little more bold, and rowl on him, as appears from the Original:</hi> Gal. Pſal. 37. <hi>We may diſcharge our load and caſt it upon Christ, and having brought our Souls to Chriſt, we muſt commit them to his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57359:71"/>charge, if they periſh it will be his fault: Thus St.</hi> Paul <hi>did,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>And now we must hide our ſelves in Christ, as the Dove in the rock,</hi> Cant. 2.14. <hi>Christ's Wounds are the clefts of the rock, where the believing Soul hides it ſelf: But this is not enough yet, we muſt put on Christ,</hi> Rom. 13.14. <hi>that is, his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which is a most beautiful Robe to cover our nakedneſs; if we would get the bleſſing, we muſt go to God, as</hi> Jacob <hi>did, in the Robes of our elder Brother; though this reſemblance doth not very well pleaſe me: For though</hi> Jacob <hi>was a good man, yet this looks like a cunning trick, to rob his elder Brother, and cheat his blind Father; and men must not think, that God is thus to be impoſed upon; when we are united to Chriſt, and made one with him, all is ours, as the Apoſtle tells us. And now what better proof can you deſire for all this, if you will be contented with expreſs words? No man would have dream'd of ſuch Interpretations of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, who had not been prepoſſeſt with the myſterious Notion of a fanciful <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to Chriſt, and Application of Chriſt to us; for here is no other proof of this, but words and phraſes ſeparated from the body of the Text, and the deſign of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and like ſtraglers picked up and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57359:72"/>listed into the ſervice of their</hi> Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis. <hi>The whole myſtery of this and a great deal more ſtuff of this nature conſiſts, in wreſting Metaphorical expreſſions to a proper ſence: When the Scripture deſcribes the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, a ſincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Obedience to the Goſpel, by having of Chriſt, being in him, coming to him, and receiving of him, theſe men expound theſe phraſes to a proper natural ſence, to ſignifie I know not what unintelligible <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and cloſure of the Soul with him.</hi>

                  <p>I never yet took any pleaſure in Drollery,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> and leaſt of all when it ſports it ſelf with Scripture, which is ſacred all over to the loweſt Hem and Fringe of Metaphors: Methinks no man can play with theſe, but he will meet with ſome ſtops or Remora's in Conſcience; the tragical Stories of <hi>Theopompus</hi> and <hi>Theodectes,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> might ſerve for retractives, or the Reverence of Scripture might fly in the face, as the Fringe did in that Jew's, who was addreſſing himſelf to his forbidden pleaſure.

                     <hi>they argue from their own preconceived Notions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove their own Scheme from Scripture, but in truth prove the ſence of Scripture by its agreement with their Opinions; which is juſt ſuch a trick as the Papiſts have got, to prove the Church from Scripture, and the Scripture from the Church. Thus after all their talk of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57359:79"/>being juſtified by the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, the Scripture tells us, that we are justified by Faith, have remiſſion by Faith, have peace with God by Faith, are ſanctified by Faith, are the ſons of God by Faith, are ſaved by Faith: Now how is this reconcilable with being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by imputed Righteouſneſs? Why, thus;</hi> Faith doth not juſtifie abſolutely, as Faith, but relatively, as it brings us to Chriſt, and apprehends his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>This is their own preconceived o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, or elſe no man could have ſtumbl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this Diſtinction: But their Reaſon is plain; Should Faith juſtifie as Faith, as our own Act, it would be as bad as good Works, and irreconcilable with the Grace of God; though modest men dream not of meriting, though Faith had juſtified as our Act; ſince the Reward doth ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exceed the Work, that there can be no ſuſpicion of Merit, and where there is no Merit, the Reward is of Grace.</hi>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57359:79"/>
                     <hi>The Scripture ſaith that we are justified by Faith;</hi> very well; but what by Faith excluſively of its Object, Chriſt's Blood and Righteouſneſs? No ſurely; then the Scripture, which tells us, <hi>That we are juſtified by Faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3.25. <hi>and made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by his obedience,</hi> Rom. 5.19. muſt contradict it ſelf; or what, excluſively to the imputation of theſe? No nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the imputation of theſe we cannot be entitled to them to our Juſtification: Now that Faith juſtifies not abſolutely, and as our Act, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: In Juſtification there is a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al proceeding, and we muſt anſwer to ſomething, to the Goſpel only, or to the Law alſo; if to the Goſpel only, then Evangelical Juſtification is in a way fruſtrative and not perfective of the Law; there needeth only Faith to anſwer the Goſpel, and not perfect Righteouſneſs to anſwer the Law: But what ſaith the Apoſtle to this? Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluded Juſtification to be by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.30. he immediatly adds, <hi>Do we then make void the Law through faith? God forbid, yea, we eſtabliſh the Law,</hi> ver. 31. And how is this? That Faith, which anſwers to the Goſpel, receives that perfect Righteouſneſs of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57359:80"/>Chriſt, which anſwers the Law in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, <hi>Chriſt being the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> as we have it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. Without this, it is not at all imaginable how Faith, or Juſtification by it, ſhould eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh or complete the Law; our ſincere Obedience, which flows from Faith, can no more do it than imperfection can reach perfection. Again, if to the Goſpel only, then all the Pagans muſt needs be juſtified, for they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to anſwer unto; not to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that is not reveiled to them; not to the Law of Nature, that is but the relicts and broken pieces of the Moral Law: And if Chriſtians, who have the Moral Law in its entire perfection, are not to anſwer to it, then ſurely Pagans, who have only ſome little Fragments of it, need not anſwer thereunto, and by conſequence they muſt be <hi>recti in Curia</hi> before God: But if (as of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we muſt) we muſt anſwer to the Law alſo, then Faith, as it is in it ſelf, and our Act, cannot poſſibly juſtifie; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a piece of the Law, and that imperfect; God, who judgeth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to truth, will not eſteem thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous, who are not ſo indeed, nor accept of a partial Righteouſneſs
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57359:80"/>for a total one. If reply be made, This is true, when God judgeth <hi>Judicio Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiae,</hi> but not when he judges <hi>Judicio Miſericordiae;</hi> he in his condeſcending Mercy accepts of Faith in the room of total, perfect Righteouſneſs: I anſwer, this cannot poſſibly ſtand, God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Truth are never at variance; his Truth will not eſteem us righteous upon account of a partial imperfect righteouſneſs, and his Mercy will not condeſcend ſo far, as to interfere with his Truth: But when he eſteems us righteous upon account of a perfect Righteouſneſs, which is not our own, but Chriſt's, then Truth and Mercy both ſhine forth; Truth, in that there is a perfect Righteouſneſs to anſwer the Law; and Mercy, in that it is not our own, but our Sureties. But further; If Faith be taken for a perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, then it is lifted up into the room of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs: If you ſay, no, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is the foundation of this acceptance of Faith; I anſwer, Then will it follow, that Chriſt died not ſo much for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to juſtifie them, as for Graces, to elevate Faith above it ſelf into the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation of a perfect Righteouſneſs; and withal, that Faith is our proper
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57359:81"/>Righteouſneſs in an immediate formal way, and Chriſt but a remote Cauſe only; much after the ſame rate as the Papiſts ſay, <hi>Bona opera tincta ſanguine Chriſti juſtificant:</hi> Works are made the immediate Cauſe of Juſtification, and Chriſt the remote. Moreover, it is to be remembred, that nothing can be <hi>Inſtrumentum &amp; inſtrumentatum;</hi> the Artificers Tools are not the Houſe he makes; the Hyſops ſprinkling of Blood in the Jewiſh Sacrifices was not the Blood of Chriſt; Faith is not our Righteouſneſs, but the <hi>Medium</hi> to it: Hence, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. we read <hi>of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by faith:</hi> it is not it ſelf our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but a means to it. Thus it appears, that Faith in it ſelf and as our Act juſtifies not; therefore it juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies as it is that Evangelical <hi>Medium</hi> which receives Chriſt and his perfect Righteouſneſs. Thus the Reverend <hi>Hooker, Faith is the only hand, which putteth on Christ to Justification, and Chriſt the only Garment which being ſo put on covereth the ſhame of our defiled Natures, hideth the imperfection of our Works, preſerveth us blameleſs in the ſight of God; before whom otherwiſe the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Faith were cauſe ſufficient to make us culpable, yea, to ſhut us from the

What follows in the Author, <hi>Will the Father elect and the Son redeem none but thoſe who are holy?</hi> is a very ſtrange Queſtion: <hi>Will they?</hi> as if the Book of Life were yet unwritten, and the Blood of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yet unſhed: <hi>The Father hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected us, that we ſhould be holy,</hi> Eph. 1.4. and how can he elect us being ſuch? <hi>The Son gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. and how could we be holy before? However, no diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is caſt upon Holineſs, which, though it do not antecede Election and Redemption, yet it ſweetly ſtreams and iſſues from thence; and Believers are obliged to follow after it, as they will

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57359:89"/>between Juſtification and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: Juſtification is an Action of God without us, Sanctification an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit within us; the one is by the perfect Righteousneſs of Chriſt imputed, the other by the holy Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit infuſed and inherent in us: In the one we are freed from the Guilt of Sin, in the other from the Corruption and Pollution of it: By the one we have a Title to God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by the other a Meetneſs for it; it being ſuch as no unclean thing can enter into the ſame. And what colour of Repugnancy is there between theſe two? and how doth the one make the other uſeleſs?

At least it might be the</hi> Cauſa ſine qua non, <hi>and that will make it a Condition: But not to diſpute about words; I am content it ſhould be only a way to life, but, what becomes of Chriſt then, who is the only way? Cannot Chriſt's Righteouſneſs ſave us without our own? Doth Chriſt's Righteouſneſs free us from guilt, and entitle us to Glory, and yet can we not be ſaved without Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs?

At leaſt it might be</hi> Cauſa ſine qua non, <hi>and ſo a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> But the Author might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the Doctor did not ſpeak <hi>ad idem,</hi> to one and the ſame thing; his words are, <hi>Holineſs is neither the Cauſe, Matter nor Condition of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it is the way to Salvation;</hi> both ſtand well together without any ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Contradiction: Obedience is ſubſequent to Juſtification, and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe, Matter nor Condition of it; but it is antecedent to Salvation, and the way thereunto. Well, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is content, <hi>that it only be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary way to eternal Life, but what then becomes of Chriſt the only way? What of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and of free
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57359:91"/>Grace?</hi> I hope there is no matter of fear; our Holineſs, unleſs it be lifted up above it ſelf into the room and Throne of Chriſt, very well comports with Chriſt and Grace: it is a way, but not, as Chriſt, an Expiatory Meritorious one; it ſtands as neceſſary in Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but eeks not out Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in Juſtification: It flows from free Grace, and doth not overturn, but magnifie its Fountain. Afterwards our Author draws up a long Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe men, <hi>That they prepoſſeſs their Fancies with arbitrary Notions, pervert the Scriptures, to juſtifie their Darling-opinions; and that ſometimes with ſo ill ſucceſs, as to break ſome ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Truths into palpable abſurdities and contradictions; their Fancies and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture agree no better than the Church of Rome and Scripture do: They add ſuch limitations, distinctions, gloſſes to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as are neceſſary to make them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. Their Acquaintance with Chriſts Perſon is only a work of Fancy, teaches men Hypocriſie, undermines the Deſign of the Goſpel; makes men incurably igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet conceited of knowledge; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent talkers and cenſurers of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; deſpiſers of their Teachers, as if ignorant and meer Moral Preachers:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57359:92"/>Their Acquaintance with Christ's Perſon warms their Fancies, moves their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſometimes they find breakings of heart, and feel the horrors of damned Spirits; ſometimes they are raviſh'd with his love and Beauty, refreſh'd with the ſweet careſſes of his love: All which may be no more than the working of a warm Enthuſiaſtick Fancy, the tranſportation of frantick Raptures and Extaſies of Love.</hi> Unto all which I ſay two things only; the one is this: In general Charges, which may be drawn up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt innocent Souls under Heaven, the intelligent Reader muſt meaſure the truth of them only by the Inſtances, which before have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined: The other is this, that the Author tells us, <hi>That their breakings for ſin, and raviſhments in Chriſt, may be but the working of a warm Enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick fancy:</hi> In which Cenſure, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there is no over-meaſure of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. There are yet Two things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, which, becauſe interwoven with the general Charge, I have hitherto omitted, but ſhall now recite them; the one is this; <hi>Prepoſſeſſed Fancies force men</hi> (ſaith the Author) <hi>to pervert the Scriptures to make them ſpeak the Orthodox Language; to this we owe all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57359:92"/>thoſe nice and ſubtil Diſtinctions, which conſtitute the Body of Syſtematical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, which commonly have no other deſign than to evade the force of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to bribe it to ſpeak on their ſide.</hi> I will now wonder no longer, that the Author treats a few Nonconformiſts with ſuch rough hands; Behold! an univerſal blaſt put on thoſe excellent Divines, which have ſtood in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant World like burning and ſhining Lights, and have ſet forth ſo many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and worthy Syſtems of Divinity for the Churches uſe: But this is All-a-mode with the Remonſtrants, who, as <hi>Vede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">De Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind.</note> have poured forth <hi>convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia atrociſſima in Formulas;</hi> not being afraid to ſay, <hi>Iſta ars eſt Sathanae,</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>humanam tyrannidem;</hi> and proceeding ſo far as to ſay, That that Preface in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed, <hi>Qui vult ſalvus eſſe ante omnia credat, &amp;c.</hi> was a proud one: Syſtems of Divinity are to them as Bonds and Fetters, which they would willingly break off, that they might have the better Scope to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce their unſound and novel Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. The other is this: <hi>It is not,</hi> ſaith the Authour, <hi>the Perſon, but the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is the way, the truth and the life.</hi> It ſeems the new

I have eſpouſed you to one husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Chriſt. <hi>Christ is a Shepherd, and that concerns the whole flock; Chriſt is a Rock, a corner ſtone, and the Church an holy Temple: All theſe Metaphors in their first and moſt proper uſe refer to the whole Society of Christians; the union of particular Chriſtians to Chriſt, is by means of their union to the Church; the Church is the body of Chriſt, and every Chriſtian by being united to this body, becomes a member of Chriſt:</hi> As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular: 1 Cor. 12.27. <hi>The Church is the Temple of God, and every Chriſtian a lively ſtone in it; the Church is Chriſts Spouſe, and every Chriſtian a member of that Society, but every Chriſtian is not Chriſts Spouſe; he is an enemy to</hi> Polygamy, <hi>and hath but one Spouſe, as he hath but one body, and one Church; which quite ſpoils the prettineſs and fantaſtical wit, of a late exhortation to young women, to take Chriſt for their husband; which would have ſounded much better in a Popiſh Nunnery, than among ſuch pretenders to reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57359:97"/>and to give every one their due, the Papiſts are the moſt generous ſort of ſutors for Chriſt, for they perſwade them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all other husbands for Chriſt, which is more honourable and meritorious.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe Metaphors refer to the whole Church or body of Chriſt very well;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> but are not particular Chriſtians united to Chriſt as their head, eſpouſed to him, under him as Sheep under a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, built on him as on a Rock? Yes ſurely, The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> (which is the Authors inſtance) was in proper ſpeech, no more the whole body of Chriſt, than a particular Chriſtian is, and yet it was eſpouſed as a chaſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Chriſt; if a particular Chriſtian, becauſe not the whole body of Chriſt, cannot be eſpouſed to him, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can a particular Church, becauſe not ſuch, be ſo eſpouſed: And ſo the grave words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> about the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian Church, as well as the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical wit of the late Exhorter, muſt ſpoil together: But if a particular Chriſtian may be eſpouſed to Chriſt, why ſhould Miniſters who are Sutors on that behalf, be checked with a Popiſh Nunnery, as if thoſe Eſpouſals ſmelt of a ſuperſtitious Vow? The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 180. <hi>Every

Or afterwards, how was the Church Catholick united to him? Surely not by another Church, but immediately; and then to me it is unimaginable, that the whole Church ſhould be immediately united to him, and never a part ſo united, or that all believers ſhould be ſo united to him,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57359:98"/>and never an one of them ſo united: Beſides, the Church Catholick is part militant on earth, and part triumphant in Heaven; Thoſe in Heaven are no part of the viſible Church, afterwards mentioned by the Author; and withal they are at ſo great a diſtance from us, that we may as eaſily imagine an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate union to Chriſt, as to them; Thoſe on earth are not all the body of Chriſt, and ſo not properly within the Authors diſcourſe; however if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the buſineſs, thoſe <hi>vincula unionis,</hi> the holy Spirit and Faith, which unite them all immediately to Chriſt, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in particular Believers; and therefore it is a wonder to me, that thoſe particular Believers, in whom the Divine Bonds reſide, ſhould not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately united to Chriſt: It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that in caſe thoſe Bonds in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular believers ſhould be diſſolved, the whole Catholick Church on earth would be diſſolved alſo; and how then can particular perſons be leſs than immediately united to Chriſt? Add hereunto, that none are in the Church Catholick but reall Believers, and in the very inſtant of believing they are united to Chriſt; and therefore it is not at all ſuppoſeable, that they ſhould
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57359:99"/>firſt be united to the Church, and by that means to Chriſt: That place in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> quoted by the Author, <hi>Now ye are the body of Christ, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in particular</hi> proves it not: The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was not the whole body of Chriſt, neither is there any ſyllable in it to prove, that firſt we are united to the Church, and then to Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>This Opinion,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> which denies that particular Believers are immediately united to Chriſt, being, as I take it, but novel, hath not yet found its Center; but rowls about from the Catholick Church, which is made up all of Saints, to viſible particular Churches, which are made up of Believers and Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: Firſt, the Author ſpake of our Union to the Body of Chriſt, now of it to the Church Viſible. Before I made it appear, that particular Believers were immediately united to Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Church Catholick; and it is as evident, that they are ſo united to him in reſpect of the Church Viſible: On the one hand, all that are in the Church Viſible are not really united to Chriſt, the hypocritical Profeſſors do but ſeem to be ſo. It is obſerved by the Learned <hi>Whitaker,</hi> that <hi>Ecceſiae par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulares viſibilibus nexibus colligantur,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57359:102"/>Eccleſia verò Catholica inviſibilibus:</hi> A Viſible Church as ſuch is connected by viſible Bands; and more the Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction cannot be, becauſe Believers and Hypoctites (of both which the Church is made up) cannot otherwiſe be knit together; and how is it poſſible, that the Union of Believers to Chriſt, which is made by inviſible Ligatures, ſhould conſiſt in their Union to the Viſible Church, which, as ſuch, is only knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by viſible Bands? On the other hand, thoſe, which are not of the Church Viſible, may yet be really united to Chriſt: Thus the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> were but <hi>in veſtibulo,</hi> and not actually in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, and yet, if Believers, were united to Chriſt. The ſame may be ſaid of unbaptized Believers: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Valentinian</hi> died before Baptiſm, but in real Union to Chriſt; hence St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, that he had <hi>in ſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Chriſti,</hi> and that his Soul was <hi>in refrigerio.</hi> Believers, if unjuſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, are no longer in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, and yet they are in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt: The Apoſtles, as Chriſt foretold them, were to be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>caſt out of the Synagogues</hi> but never to be parted from Chriſt. Believing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants may be at a vaſt diſtance from
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57359:103"/>the Viſible Church, and yet in near ſpiritual Conjunction with Chriſt: And what if a Viſible Church turn Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate from the Goſpel? True Believers will come out of her, and, I hope, without any loſs of their Union to Chriſt. Thoſe 7000 which in the time of <hi>Elias</hi> bowed not the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> were, I ſuppoſe, joyned to no viſible Church, and yet they were a choice reſerved people unto God. Thus it appears, that Believers are immediatly united to Chriſt, in reſpect of the Viſible Church.

Baptiſm admits men into the Church Viſible, but, if Believers, they are in the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, that one Body of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; nay, Baptiſm ſuppoſes them to be ſo, becauſe it is a Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, <hi>thou mayeſt be baptized,</hi> Act. 8.37. and <hi>after</hi> the <hi>holy Ghoſt poured down on the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, water could not be forbid them,</hi> Act. 10 47.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57359:109"/>A belief of Revelations is only a dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical faith, which is found in many not united to Chriſt; Obedience is not our myſtical union to Chriſt, but a fruit of it; Chriſt and the Soul being once eſpouſed, out-comes a bleſſed progeny of good works, as ſo many reall proofs of that Divine conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is made by the Spirit and Faith; and ſhews forth it ſelf in ſuch effects, as the dead womb of nature could never have produced: Subjection to Chriſt's Authority, is either a formal actual one, ſtanding in doing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and that is the ſame with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, a fruit of our union to Chriſt, or a virtual one, conſiſting in accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt as our Lord, and this is part of that Faith, which is a bond of that Union.

Our abiding in Chriſt, and Christ's words abiding in us;</hi> are very well joyned together: Joh. 15.7. To ſhew us, that where the Soul and Chriſt are in union, there the holy words will have a manſion in the heart. Chriſt is a King, a Shepherd, an Head, an Husband; and all in a ſuperlative tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency above all others in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: He is a King who hath his Laws without us, and an inward Scept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in our hearts, making the unwilling will to become a willing one, in the day of his power: A Shepherd who ſpeaks to his Sheep, nay, and brings them into the Fold, <hi>John</hi> 10.16. who before were not in it: A Head, who ſtands above all in eminency, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences ſpiritual life and motion into the loweſt, meaneſt Believer on the

                     <hi>ſo this new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the foundation of a real and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual union: And this the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents under ſeveral notions. Firſt by the Subjection of our minds and Spirits to Chriſt, as our ſpiritual King, when we put our Souls as well as our Bodies under his Government: Hence Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in our hearts by Faith;</hi> Eph. 3.17. <hi>That is to have the ſole command and Empire of our wills and affections, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our hearts, as a man does the houſe in which he dwells: Secondly by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the ſame nature, which is the neceſſary effect of the Subjection of our minds to him; for the Goſpel of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is the trueſt image of his mind, he tranſcribed his own nature into his Laws; and therefore a ſincere Obedience to his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57359:115"/>Laws is a conformity to his nature: Hence is that exhortation,</hi> That the ſame mind may be in us as was in Chriſt: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. <hi>And to be his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,</hi> is to learn of him: <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Hence our union to Christ is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by having the Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> Rom. 8.9. If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, <hi>that is, unleſs he have that ſame temper of mind which Christ had, which is called having the Spirit, by an ordinary figure of the cauſe for the effect; for all thoſe Virtues and Graces, wherein our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Chriſt conſists, are called</hi> the fruits of the Spirit; <hi>and therefore what the Apoſtle calls,</hi> having the Spirit, <hi>in the next verſe he expreſſes by,</hi> If Chriſt be in you,, <hi>that is if you be poſſeſt with the ſame love of virtue and goodneſs, which appeared ſo eminently in him, which is much to the ſame ſence with that expreſſion of</hi> Chriſt being formed in you: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. Hence in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. He that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit: <hi>Herein conſists our union to Chriſt, that we have the ſame temper; Souls are united by an harmony of wills, this makes two one Spirit.</hi>

                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:57359:115"/>the Author is now come to own a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual union with Chriſt; and this (ſaith the Author) <hi>the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to us; firſt by the ſubjection of our minds to Chriſt, as our King; Chriſt dwells in our hearts by Faith,</hi> Eph. 3. <hi>that is, he commands there;</hi> But I take that place of the Apoſtle, to be an eminent proof of the myſtical union; it is not ſaid Chriſt commands, (though that be very true) but he dwells in our hearts, not by a piece of faith, ſuch as accepts Chriſt as our Lord, but by an entire one, ſuch as receives him in all his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: We have in thoſe words faith expreſſed, which is a bond of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical union, and where faith is, there is that other bond, the holy Spirit, which flows as rivers of living water in the believers heart; and juſt before thoſe words of <hi>Chriſts dwelling in our hearts by faith;</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>holy Spirit in the inner man,</hi> Verſe 16. which is the principal bond of that myſtical Union: And St. <hi>Chryſostom</hi> on the words ſaith, that <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57359:116"/>neceſſary effect of the ſubjection of our minds to Chriſt.</hi> To which I anſwer, If by that ſubjection be meant a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt as our Lord, it is but a part of that faith, which with its Siſter Graces make up the new creature; all Graces are found in the new creature, and among others Faith, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Chriſt in all his offices, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other in his Kingly; but if by that ſubjection be meant Obedience to his Laws, (which the Author after mentions, calling it <hi>a conformity to his nature</hi>) the new creature is not the effect of Subjection or Obedience, but the cauſe of it; true Obedience is too pure a thing, to iſſue out of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate heart; before it can come forth;<note place="margin">Enchir. cap. <hi>106.</hi>

What the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor afterwards adds, touching God's dwelling in the Church as his Temple, is ſo far from oppoſing, that it points out the Myſtical Union; eſpecially ſeeing, as the Author confeſſes, <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57359:118"/>Chriſtians are in Scripture ſtiled the Temple of the living God:</hi> That place quoted by the Author, <hi>Know ye not, that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16. is very emphatical; Chriſtians are the Temple of God, and made ſo by the indwelling Spirit, which is the bond of the Myſtical Union. Indeed the Author ſaith, <hi>That the indwelling of the Spirit primarily refers to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts of the Spirit, which God in that Age beſtowed on the Church; this was the true</hi> Shechinah <hi>or divine Glory resting on them:</hi> But I conceive the holy Spirit hath been in Believers in all Ages: God dwelt in the Jewiſh Temple in Types and Symbols of his Preſence, but, which was far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than thoſe outward ſhadows and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Glory, he dwelt even then by his Spirit in all true Believers. The ſweet ſtrains of Devotion in <hi>David</hi> did plainly evidence, that the holy Spirit was in him; the ſpiritual Imbroidery or Needle-work in every Pſalm, tells us, that the Finger of God was there: The believing Iſraelites, <hi>in Mannâ Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum intellexerunt, ſaw Christ in their Manna</hi> and fed on the ſame ſpiritual Meat, as believing Chriſtians do; which
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57359:118"/>is a clear proof that the holy Spirit was in them. The Son of God coming in the Fleſh, the holy Spirit was poured down in extraordinary Gifts; and, though thoſe Epiphanies of divine Glory went off, yet the ſame Spirit hath been and ever will be in Believers.

For a Mediator, as Mediator, ought not to be conſidered as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but as the Miniſter of Grace: God the Father ought to come in for a ſhare at leaſt in being the Fountain of Grace, though the Dr. is pleaſed to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him.

But, ſaith the Author, <hi>All that the Goſpel tells us, is, That Christ loved Sinners, ſo as to die for them, and that he loves good men, who believe and obey the Goſpel:</hi> But ſure this is not all; Chriſt in his Love doth

This Opinion doth not aſcribe Eyes and Hands to God, as the groſs Anthropomorphites did, but it aſſimilates him to the filly turnings and windings of the Creature.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57359:136"/>God's electing Love antecedes all Goodneſs in in Men; and if his elect Veſſels fall into great ſins, as holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did, and this after their Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, however the Light of God's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance be for a time ſuſpended, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their habitual Graces be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and their Conſciences wounded, yet the Foundation of God ſtands ſure; electing Love remains unvariable, and will revive them again by Repentance.

The Scripture is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in it: St. <hi>Paul is a choſen veſſel,</hi> Act. 9. <hi>Jacob was loved, and that before he was born, or had done any good at all,</hi> Rom. 9. <hi>The Lord knoweth thoſe that are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. <hi>He calleth his ſheep by Name,</hi> Joh. 10.3. <hi>Some are drawn of the Father,</hi> Joh. 6.44. <hi>Some are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57359:139"/>to purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28. <hi>On ſome God will have mercy, when he hardens others,</hi> Rom. 9.18. All which places places prove that electing Love is of particular perſons, who, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath it, <hi>certiſſimè liberantur, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſaved, when others are left in maſſa perditionis.</hi> Unleſs this be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that great Deſign of a Church, which is the Maſter-piece of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, muſt be carried on in ſuch a lame and imperfect manner, as if God (which is unworthy of him) ſhould ſay, I would have a Church, but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not who ſhall make it up: Such a Jeofail is hardly to be found in a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man. But ſaith the Author, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeableneſs of God's Love doth not conſist in being determined to the ſame Object, but in that he always loves for the ſame Reaſon, that is, he always loves true Vertue and Goodneſs, where-ever he ſees it, and never ceaſes to love any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, till he ceaſes to be good: he always loves for the ſame Reaſon; where Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, there he loves, where Goodneſs is not, there he loves not:</hi> This is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's meaning, this is loving for the ſame Reaſon: But if this had been ſo, what could have become of Man, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, lapſed Man, in whom, as our
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57359:139"/>Church tells us, there is not a ſpark of Goodneſs? How deſperate muſt his caſe have been? Divine Love could not poſſibly have let out a drop of Mercy to ſuch an one, much leſs have ſhewed forth it ſelf in ſuch an unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le'd Act, as the Miſſion of his own Son for our Redemption, there being not in any Son of <hi>Adam</hi> naturally, ſo much Goodneſs (the only reaſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Author of divine Love) as might attract the leaſt crumb of Comfort on Earth, or the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Reprieve from Hell. But ſaith the Author, <hi>Should he love a wicked man, the Reaſon and Nature of his Love would change:</hi> He cannot love a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man with a Love of Complacence, but cannot he love him in Deſign, or with a Love of Benevolence? Then, (though, as the Author tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 88. <hi>he did paſſionately deſire and deſign the Happineſs of Man</hi>) yet he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to him (being in a lapſed corrupt Eſtate) a Chriſt, or a Goſpel, or any the leaſt Means of Salvation; <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the only reaſon of Love,</hi> being gone by the Fall, nothing that is good could be intended to him. The Author ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that God loves Goodneſs in Men, but whence came that Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57359:140"/>Was it a Donative of Divine Love or not? If ſo, then he loved them before they were ſuch; if not, then may we ſay with the Pelagians, <hi>A Deo habemus, quòd homines ſumus, à nobis ipſis, quòd justi ſumus; though God be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our Being, yet he is not to our Goodneſs,</hi>

                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:57359:141"/>the Grace of God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teins the moſt clear and perſpicuous Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Divine Will, in oppoſition to the Types and Shadows under the Law; is Truth, in oppoſition to Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; this is the Fulneſs we receive from Christ, a perfect Revelation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, concerning the Salvation of Mankind, which conteins ſo many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Promiſes, that it may be well be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Grace, and preſcribes ſuch a plain and ſimple Religion, ſo agreeable to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations of Good and Evil, that it may well be called Truth: This Fulneſs dwelt only in Chriſt, and from him alone we receive it; for none of the Prophets, who were before him, did ſo perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Will of God as he did:</hi> No man hath ſeen God at any time, but the only begotten Son, who is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>No man ever before had ſo perfect a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Will of God</hi> (<hi>which is here called</hi> ſeeing God, <hi>becauſe ſight gives the most perfect knowledge</hi>) <hi>but the Son, who understood all his moſt ſecret counſels, hath perfectly declared the Will of the Father to us: and hence that Fulneſs we receive from Christ is explained by</hi> Grace for Grace, <hi>which ſignifies the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Grace manifeſted in the

This Fulneſs was firſt in the Perſon of Chriſt, before he could communicate it to us; yet it is not this Perſonal Fulneſs we are to attend to, but the Fulneſs and Perfection of his Goſpel, from whence we muſt fetch the knowledge of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will.</hi>

                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>And of his fulneſs we all received, and Grace for Grace:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arſwer.</note> Upon this Text the only <hi>Quaere</hi> is, Whether by Fulneſs is meant, the Fulneſs of Chriſt's Perſon, or the Fulneſs of his Goſpel? I conceive here is clearly meant the Fulneſs of Chriſt's Perſon; it is in the Text <hi>his fulneſs,</hi> his, who is <hi>God the Word,</hi> ver. 1. his, <hi>who was in the beginning with God,</hi> ver. 2. his, <hi>by whom all things were made,</hi> ver. 3. his, <hi>who is the true light, that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> ver. 9, his, <hi>who was made fleſh and dwelt among</hi>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57359:143"/>abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin:</hi> In <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6 we have <hi>the circumciſion of the heart;</hi> in the 37. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. we have <hi>the Law of God in the heart,</hi> as the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a righteous man: We have the holy Spirit in the Saints; hence <hi>David</hi> ſiducially prayes, <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from me,</hi> Pſal. 51.11.

But in that 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> two things are pointed out to us; the one is this, That the Evangelical Truths and Graces, after the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, though in Subſtance but the ſame, were gradually far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than before; thoſe Truths, which under the Law were in Shadows
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57359:143"/>and dark Reſemblances, after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt appeared in Splendour and evidential Glory; thoſe Graces, which under the Law were but as Drops and in leſſer meaſures, after his coming were as Showers and in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er plenty: The other is this, That Chriſt is in a tranſcendent manner ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent above <hi>Moſes;</hi> though there were Grace under the Law, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> could not communicate it; he could declare the Law or Doctrine, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Man, a Miniſter, he could go no further: Juſt as <hi>John</hi> could baptize with water, but then he was at his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: <hi>Moſes</hi> could no more communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Grace then <hi>John</hi> could baptize with the holy Ghoſt and Fire; but Chriſt diſpenſes more than meer Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he communicates Grace it ſelf: Hence it appears, that in that 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> there is more than bare Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine oppoſed to the Law, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Chriſt. I confeſs the Goſpel to be the Charter and <hi>Medium</hi> of Grace, but it is in the Royal hand of Chriſt to communicate it, and that from his own Perſon: <hi>He is a Prince and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Act. 5.31. Moreover, if all Grace, and the fulneſs of it be only in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57359:144"/>in the outward Doctrine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Gods Will, as the Author ſeems to hint, what becomes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Grace?

If we fetch Life from Chriſt, may we not believe and obey the Goſpel? Or if we believe and obey the Goſpel, may we not fetch Life from Chriſt? What ſtrange inconſiſtencies are theſe? The <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> tuſted in Chriſt, and yet heard the Goſpel of Salvation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. they were for the great Purchaſer and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Life, and yet caſt not away the Charter; The Jews ſearched the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and yet ſhould have gone to Chriſt for Life; they thought they had Eternal Life in the Scriptures, and, which was their folly, they thought they had it there in a way ſeparate from Chriſt; but he told them, that

Nay, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obeying the Goſpel are ſo far from being inconſiſtent with fetching Life from Chriſt, that they cannot be without it; Without Life from Chriſt, how or which way ſhould a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or obey the Goſpel?

No ſurely, that, which of it ſelf is not ſufficient ſo much as to raiſe up an holy thought, or to ſay, Jeſus is the Lord, cannot of it ſelf believe or obey the Goſpel: Or may Nature and Doctrine do it?

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57359:154"/>thus the Goſpel is called,</hi> the power of God to them that believe: Rom. 1.16. <hi>And</hi> by this fooliſhneſs of preaching, <hi>that is, by preaching this fooliſh Doctrine (as it was accounted by the world) of a crucified Chriſt;</hi> it pleaſed God to ſave them that believe: <hi>Chriſt being exalted to the right hand of Majeſty, may in a proper ſence be called the power of God, becauſe all power is given to him in Heaven and earth, and he hath the ſupreme Government of all the affairs of this ſpiritual Kingdom, and this is a perſonal power inherent in him; but the exerciſe of it is confined to the Rules of the Goſpel; he hath power to ſave thoſe that believe and obey, and to destrey his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; this power cannot ſave any man whom the Goſpel condemns; we have no reaſon to truſt to his perſonal power, unleſs we firſt obey his Goſpel; however omnipotent he be, his Goſpel is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his actings, if that condemn us, his omnipotent power will not ſave us.</hi>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57359:155"/>way of excellency above the Goſpel: The Goſpel is the wiſdom of God, a Glaſs of it, and a Divine Medium to illuminate, and make us wiſe; but all this under Chriſt the brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, and great illuminator; from whom the unction or teaching an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing of the Spirit of Wiſdom and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation deſcends down upon us, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our eyes &amp; hearts upon the glorious things in the Goſpel: The Goſpel is the power of God, a Divine Scepter, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and overcome the wills and hearts of men; but this is under Chriſt, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word and power of God, who by that Scepter produces that great and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural effect.

                     <hi>viz.</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: <hi>Now no Chriſtian will deny, that Christ was very righteous, a great example of univerſal holineſs and purity; and it muſt be confeſſed, that his Righteouſneſs was not an imaginary, imputed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but inherent and perſonal; but what comfort is this to us, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue wilful, incorrigible ſinners:</hi> Yes, <hi>ſaith the Doctor,</hi> Haſt thou the ſence of guilt upon thee? Chriſt is complete Righteouſneſs, the Lord our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; this makes Chriſt ſutable to the wants of a ſinner indeed, that he hath a Righteouſneſs for him, which God infinitely prefers before any home-ſpun Righteouſneſs of his own. <hi>This is a very comfortable Notion for bad men, and ſuch as I would not part with for all the world, did I reſolve to live
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57359:156"/>wickedly, and yet intend to go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but it is good to be ſure in a matter of importance.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſts Righteouſneſs was not an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary imputed Righteouſneſs,</hi>

                     <hi>but inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and perſonal;</hi> thus the Author: It was not imaginary, but inherent; very true; but was it not imputed to him? Then Chriſt would never have appealed to God, as he doth, <hi>Surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God,</hi> Iſai. 49.4. God would never have accounted him as righteous, or promiſed him a Seed, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 53.10. he would never have ſaid, <hi>This is my well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Matth. 3.17. neither would he ever have exalted him, and <hi>given him a name above every name,</hi> Phil. 2.9. In a word; if his Active and Paſſive Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs were not reckoned or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of by God, then he could not be our Saviour, or pay a Ranſom or Satisfaction to divine Juſtice for us. What follows in the Author, <hi>That this Righteouſneſs may be a comfort to wilful incorrigible ſinners,</hi> is, as I have before manifeſted, a meer Popiſh Calumny.</p>
                  <p>But before I proceed any further with the Author, I ſhall crave lieve of the Reader a little to ſtate and prove
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57359:157"/>this point, That we are juſtified before God by the Imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and then I ſhall proceed with the Author.</p>
                  <p>Juſtification may be conſidered in a double Notion; there is Conſtitutive Juſtification, whereby we are made righteous before God; and Sententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, whereby we are pronounced ſuch at Judgment: I chiefly aim at the firſt, upon which the ſecond follows as a conſequent. Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is either Active, ſuch as fulfilled the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law, or Paſſive, ſuch as bore the Curſe of it; I take in both. The Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, either that Fundamental Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, whereby it is ſo far reckoned or accounted unto men in general, as to make them capable of Juſtification upon Goſpel-terms; or that after par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Imputation, whereby it is ſo far reckoned or accounted to Believers in particular, as to conſtitute them righteous before God: The firſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ſevers men from lapſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; the ſecond ſevers Men from Men, Believers from Unbelievers. The firſt we have in ſuch Scripture-expreſſions as tell us, <hi>that Chriſt died for us;</hi> for unleſs his Death were in ſome ſence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57359:157"/>to us, it was no more for us than for Devils: The ſecond we have in ſuch Scripture-expreſſions as tell us, <hi>that we are justified by his blood;</hi> for his Blood juſtifies us not, unleſs it be actually particularly made ours, and made ours it cannot be without an Imputation: We have both together, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>He hath reconciled all things,</hi> and a little after, <hi>yet now hath he reconciled you;</hi> all things in the firſt ſence, and you, O believing Coloſſians, in the ſecond; Reconciliation was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally particularly imputed unto them, which was before applicable to all. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſecond particular Imputation in this diſcourſe. That which I aſſert is this, That Believers are juſtified or conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteous before God, by the Active and Paſſive Righteouſneſs of Chriſt actually particularly applied unto them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, as is meet, let us open our eyes upon Scripture, which is the only infallible Rule; there often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs that memorable phraſe, <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God,</hi> which cannot but be of conſiderable moment in this matter: And what doth it import? our own inherent Graces, or Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? Not our inherent Graces,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:57359:158"/>for theſe, though they come down from Heaven, are never called the Righteouſneſs of God; nay, on the contrary, they are called our own: Hence the Fath of the Romans is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>your Faith,</hi> Rom. 1.8. the Love of the Corinthians, <hi>your Love.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8. the Patience of Chriſt's Diſciples. <hi>your Patience, Luk.</hi> 21.19. the Hope of the ſcattered Chriſtians, <hi>your Hope,</hi> 1 <hi>pet.</hi> 1.21. That which is called in Scripture the Righteouſneſs of God is not the ſame with that which is called our own there, but it imports the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, which by Imputation is made ours: This is called the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God, becauſe it is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt who is God, (for ſo his Blood is called, <hi>the blood of God,</hi> and his Life laid down, <hi>the life of God</hi>) and not a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inherent in us: And withal it is a perfect Righteouſneſs (which can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt before the Tribunal of God himſelf, and in which the pure Eyes of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One can find no ſpot or blemiſh at all) and not an imperfect one, ſuch as our inherent Graces are. But that the Righteouſneſs of God imports Chriſt's Righteouſneſs will further appear by the places wherein that phraſe is uſed:
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:57359:158"/>Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>For therein is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God reveiled from faith to ſaith:</hi> In the precedent Verſe he ſaith, That <hi>the Goſpel is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth;</hi> and how ſo? Why, becauſe it reveils the Righteouſneſs of God, which ſaves the Believer, and delivers him from the wrath, which in the ſubſequent Verſe is declared to be <hi>reveiled from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men:</hi> And can our inherent Graces expiate ſin and avert wrath? Oh, no; theſe, ſuch are their ſpots and imperfections, muſt paſs with God <hi>cum Venia,</hi> with a pardon of their defects, and under the Wings of Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; that, that alone expiates ſin and averts wrath; no other but that can be the Righteouſneſs of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Text. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God is by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that believe:</hi> Inherent Graces are not upon us, but in us; but Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as that in the Text, is not in us, but upon us: Inhererent Graces are not the matter of our Juſtification, of which the Apoſtle there treats, but of Sanctification; Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not the matter of our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57359:159"/>but of our Juſtification, which is the very thing there treated of: Hence it appears, that the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in this place is that of Chriſt. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>They ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not themſelves to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God;</hi> and what was that? The next Verſe tells us, <hi>For Chriſt is the and of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth;</hi> and which way was Chriſt the End of the Law, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting inherent Graces to the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or by his own perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to him? Not by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Graces, alas! theſe are ſo far from reaching the perfection of the Law, that they are full of defects, and every defect is no leſs than <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a falling ſhort of the Law: <hi>Profectò il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud quod minus eſt quàm debet, ex vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio eſt,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, That which is leſs than it ought to be, is ſo far ſinful, as it is leſs than it ought to be:</hi> Nothing leſs than the pure Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which anſwers the Law in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, can be the Righteouſneſs of God in this place. Thus 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God in him;</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of a Righteouſneſs in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57359:159"/>our ſelves, but in him; not of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs inherent, but imputed: Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is made ours, as our ſins were made his, and that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Imputation.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57359:161"/>mentioned in Scripture. I now proceed to other Scriptures: <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 4.5. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, it is reckoned or imputed for Righteouſneſs: Now is Faith taken here properly abſolutely in it ſelf? or is it taken relatively with reſpect to its Object, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? Properly abſolutely in it ſelf it is a Work; the Apoſtle oppoſes believing to working, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and ſpeaks of a Righteouſneſs without Works, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Faith therefore is not here taken abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely; for ſo Faith is a Work, and believing working: Faith abſolutely taken is our own; hence we meet with thoſe Phraſes, <hi>Thy faith,</hi> and <hi>My faith,</hi> Jam. 2.18. But that which juſtifies us is not our own, but the Righteouſneſs of God; the Righteouſneſs which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies is through Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. and not Faith it ſelf: <hi>Faith is the hypostaſis of things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11.1. but the juſtifying Righteouſneſs is not the <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis,</hi> but the very thing hoped for. <hi>We by faith wait for the hope of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Gal. 5.5. That Righteouſneſs, which juſtifies us, is the Righteouſneſs, which is imputed to us; but <hi>we are
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57359:161"/>juſtified by Chriſt's blood,</hi> Rom. 5.9. <hi>we are made righteous by his obedience, Rom.</hi> 5.19. theſe therefore are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us for Righteouſneſs: It is not Faith in it ſelf is our Righteouſneſs, but its Object, the Blood and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt. Another famous place we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. there <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt are ſet forth as two Roots; <hi>Adam</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying to the Branches, naturally in him, Sin and Death; and Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying to the Branches, ſpiritually in him, Righteouſneſs and Life: <hi>As by the offence of one judgment came upon all to condemnation, ſo by the righteouſneſs of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life: As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be made righteous,</hi> ver. 18, 19.

Righteouſneſs ſometimes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies mercy; and ſo the Lord our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, is the Lord that doth good to us:</hi> Thus the Author, righteouſneſs in ſome places ſignifies mercy: Very well, but where do we meet with <hi>Jehovah</hi> our mercy? Or, becauſe it ſignifies ſo in ſome Texts, muſt it do ſo in all? The queſtion is, what it ſignifies in this place; Chriſt borrows not his Name from temporal bleſſings: no, that is too low: The Salvation their ſpoken of is a ſpiritual and eternal one, that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is procured by the active and paſſive righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that righteouſneſs is made ours by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                     <hi>that in all the hiſtories of the Goſpel, which gives us an account of our Saviours Sermons, and parables; whereby he instructed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all neceſſary truths, he makes no mention at all of imputed righteouſneſs: but exacts from them a righteouſneſs of their own, if they would find mercy with God: Now it is very ſtrange, (if imputed righteouſneſs be the great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-mystery) that our Saviour ſhould not once mention it, nor warn his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to beware of tructing in their own righteouſneſs: but that instead of this he ſhould ſeverely enjoyn them the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of an univerſal righteouſneſs, as the only thing that pleaſes God, and ſeverely threaten thoſe, who continue in any ſin, who break the least of his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they ſhall not enter heaven: This to me is a very great prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst ſuch notions, as are ſet up for the fundamentals of Chriſtianity, when there is not the least foot-ſteps of them to be ſeen in the Goſpel of our Saviour: Did not our Saviour inſtruct his hearers in

Now the Righteouſneſs of God, that is of Chriſt, as before hath been noted, is made ours only by Imputation; but where doth Chriſt ſpeak of his own Righteouſneſs? See <hi>Math.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteouſneſs,</hi> ſaith he; he fulfilled all righteouſneſs, but was it for himſelf or for us? Not for himſelf, his humane Nature was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aſſumed into his divine Perſon, but it had a Title to Heaven, and might have aſended up thither; it was for us therefore: Hence the Apoſtle ſaith expreſsly, That <hi>he was made under the Law to redeem us,</hi> Gal. 4.4. What he did as under the Law was for us; and ſuch was all his righteouſneſs, and therefore that was for us; and what was for us muſt be applicable to us, and this cannot be without an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Ea igitur Chriſti ſatisfactio, nobis ex gratiâ Dei Patris imputata atque donata, illa demum juſtitia eſt, quâ juſtificamur in Dei judicio.</hi> We ſee therefore in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Satisfaction owned, and that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily infers Imputation: <hi>Chriſts blood was ſhed for many for the remſſion of Sins,</hi> as himſelf tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. Now it could not be ſhed for us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the firſt fundamentall Imputation; neither can it be made ours to juſtifie us without an after particular Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For his Blood, when it cleanſes away our ſins, is not ours by Inheſion, therefore if it be at all ours to doe that great Work, it muſt be ſo by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Remiſſion of ſins was to be preached in his name,</hi> Luk. 24.47. and <hi>In his name ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</hi> Math. 12.21. This Name includes his Blood and Righteouſneſs and theſe are made ours by Imputation. If any reply,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57359:174"/>plainer proof is deſired, I anſwer; Several things are to be conſidered by us; There is no one place in the Goſpels to maintain Juſtification by our own Righteouſneſs, or if there were, I ſhall be bold to ſay, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches in the World are bound to yeild the Cauſe in this point to their Adverſaries the Papiſts. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods Commandements is indeed the way to heaven, but it is no where made an ingredient into our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. That place, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.19. quoted by the Author, that <hi>Whoſoever ſhall break one of the Leaſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be the Leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> if taken <hi>in rigore juris;</hi> were enough to ſhut all men out of heaven; it imports therefore, that ſincere Obedience is neceſſary to thoſe who will go thither: Again, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Light brake out as it pleaſed the Father of Lights, gradually and ſucceſſively. In <hi>Math.</hi> 16. <hi>Peter</hi> makes that famous Confeſſion, <hi>Thou art Chriſt,</hi> and was by Chriſt called, <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> for it; and a little after <hi>Peter,</hi> as ignorant of Chriſt's Paſſion, would have diverted him from it, and for that was called, <hi>Satan:</hi> Chriſt's Paſſion was ſure a moſt neceſſary thing, vet he knew it not.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57359:175"/>Further, our Saviour tells the Apoſtles, that <hi>It was expedient for them, that he ſhould go away;</hi> why ſo? Then <hi>the spirit ſhould come, which ſhould guide them into all truth, which ſhould glorifie Chriſt, which ſhould take of Christs, and ſhould ſhew it unto them,</hi> Joh. 16.7, 13, 14, 15. Obſerve, the Spirit was to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and diſplay the things of Chriſt; amongſt others, his blood and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in their glory, and true uſe to be made ours; and now it is no wonder at all, if imputed Righteouſneſs be more fully laid down in the Epiſtles, than in the Sermons of our Saviour Chriſt himſelf; the wiſdom of heaven reſerved that fuller light, till the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the holy Ghoſt. Moreover, we muſt diſtinguiſh between the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Chriſts imputed righteouſneſs in it ſelf, and the neceſſity of the knowledge of it: Imputed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſince the fall hath ever been neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in it ſelf; no man was ever juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied without Chriſt's blood applyed to him, and that application is made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believing by way of imputation; but the knowledge of it hath been more or leſs neceſſary, as the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal light hath more or leſs reveiled it. St. <hi>Peter</hi> at that time of his confeſſion
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57359:175"/>was no doubt juſtified by Chriſt's blood; and yet he then had not the knowledge of his paſſion. Laſtly, it appears plainly, that our Saviour warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hearers not to truſt in their own Righteouſneſs: Thus the Phariſee and the Publican are in the Parable ſet forth <hi>to thoſe that trusted in themſelves, that they were righteous,</hi> Luk. 18.19. The Phariſee boaſts of his Juſtice, Purity, Sanctity: The Publican cries out of his ſins, and begs for mercy; and as our Saviour tells us, <hi>went away jeſtified rather than the other:</hi> So true is that of Proſper, <hi>Melior eſt in malis factis humilis confeſſio, quàm in bonis ſuperbagloriatio:</hi> To conclude, I hope by theſe things it appears, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Saviour was unfaithful in his prophetical Office; nor the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts in giving us an account of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Doctrine.</p>

                     <hi>or Righteouſneſs by the Faith of Chriſt: Now Faith in Chriſt, is often ujed objectively for the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is the Object of our Faith; and ſo the Righteouſneſs of Faith, or by the Faith of Chriſt, is that Righteouſneſs which the Goſpel commands: Thus Acts.</hi> 24. Felix ſent for Paul, and heard him
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57359:177"/>concerning the Faith of Chriſt, <hi>that is,</hi> concerning righteouſneſs, temperance and the judgment to come, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. <hi>which are the principal Matters of the Goſpel; Thus obedience to the Faith, is obedience to the Goſpel,</hi> Rom. 1.5. <hi>In this ſence Faith and Works are oppoſed in St. Paul's Epiſtles:</hi> the <hi>Diſpute in the Epistle to the Romans is, Whether we muſt be juſtified by the Law of Moſes, or by the faith of Chriſt, that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the obſervation of all the external Rites and Ceremonies, and an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conformity of our Actions to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Precepts of it will justify a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, or that ſincere univerſal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which the Goſpel of Chriſt requires, which tranſformes our Minds into the likeneſs of God. and makes us new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? And that this Righteouſneſs of Faith, and this alone can recommend us to God, the Apoſtle proves from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Abraham, in the</hi> 4. <hi>Chapter. who was accounted righteous for the ſake of his ſincere and stedfaſt belief of Gods Promiſes;</hi> verſ. 3. Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs: <hi>And this, while he was uncircumciſed, which is a convincing argument againſt the Jews, that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſton, and the obſervation of the Law
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57359:178"/>of</hi> Moſes, <hi>is not neceſſary to juſtification, becauſe</hi> Abraham, <hi>the Father of the faithful, and pattern for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was juſtified without it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Righteouſneſs of God,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: And this is called the Righteouſneſs of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he accepts it, and imputes it to us: And a Righteouſneſs through the Faith of Chriſt, becauſe Faith receives it: The Righteouſneſs of God is not Faith it ſelf, but a <hi>righteouſneſs through the faith of Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.9. Faith, I confeſs, is ſometimes put for the Goſpel; but the queſtion is not what it is in other places, but what in thoſe which ſpeak of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God: Mark that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>therein,</hi> that is, in the Goſpel, <hi>is the righteouſneſs of God reveiled from faith to faith.</hi> Here Faith is not put for the Goſpel; for then the Righteouſneſs of God ſhould be reveiled from Goſpel to Goſpel: Nay, here we have the Goſpel, the Righteouſneſs of God and Faith, all ſet down as diſtinct things: And in other Scriptures, we have the Grace of Faith mentioned with the Righteouſneſs of God, becauſe Faith receives that Righteouſneſs: The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> required not only
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57359:178"/>external conformity; but internal Sanctity, and that in all perfection; the Apoſtle in the fourth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> excludes not only external obſervations; but the works of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Abraham</hi> from juſtification; Faith is accounted for Righteouſneſs, not properly abſolutely in it ſelf, but relatively with reſpect to its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Jeſus Chriſt, as I have before proved.</p>

                     <hi>but</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was accounted to him for Righe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: Chriſt indeed was the material Object of</hi> Abrahams <hi>Faith; that is, he believed that promiſe, which God made of ſending Chriſt into the world; upon which account our Saviour tells the Jews:</hi> Your father Abraham rejoyed to ſee my day, and he ſaw it, and was glad, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.56. <hi>But no man could believe in Chriſt till he came; that is, could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing upon his Authority, which is the true Notion of believing in him.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57359:180"/>Glory; <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all nations be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 22.18. That is, with all ſpiritual and eternal bleſſings in Chriſt. It is not imaginable; that God ſhould ſuffer the Faith of ſo great a Believer as <hi>Abraham,</hi> to hang in the thickets of carnal things, when he had ſuch ſpiritual Promiſes before his eyes; our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Abraham ſaw his day and rejoyced,</hi> Joh. 8.56. He ſaw the day of his Incarnation; and as ſome, the day of his Paſſion: How far God carried the eyes of his Faith, I know not; however he ſaw ſo much, as put him into thoſe joys and triumphs of Faith, which pointed beyond this World to that Salvation, which is the end and center of Faith: To me it ſuffices to ſay, that <hi>Abraham</hi> reſted upon Chriſt for Salvation, and then Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though unknown to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was imputed to him: The Author ſaith, That, <hi>from in thy ſeed ſhall all nations be bleſſed, to imputed righteouſneſs, is a train of thoughts beyond Mr.</hi> Hobs, and yet (<hi>Abraham</hi> diſcerning the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in that Promiſe) it may be abſolved in two ſhort words, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall merit Spiritual Bleſſings for us, and that that merit ſhall be applyed to us; there being no other way of applying
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57359:181"/>of what is anothers, but by Faith on our part, and Imputation on Gods: The Author ask's the queſtion, <hi>Is there no poſſible way for God to bleſs the world, but by imputed Righteouſneſs?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, had not Chriſt dyed for us, which involves an imputation, nothing of bleſſing could have been expected, the wrath of God would no more have ſpared us, than it did lapſed Angels: The Jews about Chriſt's coming thought only of a temporal <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> the very Apoſtles for a time thought not of Chriſt's death; but this was becauſe they then lived in the dregs and darkneſs of the Jewiſh Church.

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57359:184"/>principles of all Religion: And God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no more of thoſe good men, who had no other particular Revelation of his Will. Secondly, There is a Faith in God, or a belief of thoſe particular Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which God made to the Fathers of the Old Teſtament: Thus</hi> Noah believed God, <hi>being warned of the deluge; and in obedience to him, provided an Ark; and this was imputed to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Thus</hi> Abraham, <hi>in obedience to the divine Revelation</hi> left his Country and Father's houſe, and went into a ſtrange Land: <hi>Thus</hi> Sarah by believing the promiſe of God, received ſtrength to conceive ſeed, and was delivered of a child, when ſhe was paſt age, becauſe ſhe judged him faithful, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: <hi>Thus</hi> Abraham, <hi>in obedience to God,</hi> offered up Iſaac, <hi>which was as heroical an act of Faith, as was ever done by man: The like examples we have of the Faith of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, <hi>and</hi> Moſes, &amp;c. <hi>Who firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all the particular Revelations God made to them, and confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the performance of all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; how unlikely ſoever they appear'd to be: This is that Faith whereby</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>and all the good men in theſe days were juſtified,</hi> viz. <hi>Such a firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us was the Goſpel preached as well as unto them,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. They were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, according to the very ſame manner as they were ſaved; that is, we and they are both ſaved by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt and his Grace. Again, it is to be conſidered, that the Sacrifices under the Law were
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57359:188"/>ordained to be as Types, and ſhadows of Chriſt, to make an Atonement for ſin (as appears in <hi>Leviticus</hi>) not that the Sacrifices themſelves were an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute real Atonement in themſelves; but a typical one, pointing out the only true atoning expiatory Sacrifice of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt. Now either God did reveil to the Jews, at leaſt wiſe to the Believers among them; the typical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the true uſe and end of thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, or not: if he did reveil it to them, then all true Believers among them did not hang upon the Shadow, and outward Sacrifice only; but by their Faith did fix upon Chriſt and his precious Blood: but if he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil it to them, the Sacrifices, even of thoſe Believers, muſt be all miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, nothing but meer blots and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata</hi>'s; they muſt be offered up not in Faith, but in miſtake, in the belief of an utter falſity; that is, in the belief of that impoſſible thing, <hi>That the blood of bulls and of goats could take away ſin:</hi> There muſt be ſuch a groſs error <hi>in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> a miſpriſion ſo horrible; that it is not imaginable, that any one among all the millions of Sacrifices under the Law, could be rightly offered up, or accepted by God: Such hard intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57359:189"/>conſequences follow this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Ancients had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, or Faith in the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> On the other hand, that they had ſuch a Knowledg and Faith, may be gathered, as from other things; ſo from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that they offered up their Sacrifices in Faith, as <hi>Abel</hi> did; that they were graciouſly accepted of by God in their offering up thoſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: Hence it is ſaid, that <hi>God had reſpect to Abel and his offering,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming it, as is thought, by fire from Heaven; and ſo giving a divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to it. Hence alſo we find, that when <hi>Noah</hi> offered burnt offerings, <hi>the Lord did ſmell a ſweet ſavour,</hi> Gen. 8.21. becauſe thoſe Sacrifices had an aſpect upon the ſweet Sacrifice of Chriſt, in which God is ever well-pleaſed.

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57359:190"/>by Faith, and imputed to us; you utterly deſtroy the Apoſtles argument for our juſtification by Faith; for</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>and all the good men of old were not juſtified by ſuch a Faith as this; they never heard of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us:</hi> Noah <hi>was made heir of Righteouſneſs, becauſe he believed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and prepared an Ark at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Faith was imputed to him for righteouſneſs, becauſe he left his own Country, followed God into a ſtrange Land, believed that God would give him a ſon, and offered this ſon at God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Now what hath all this to do with an imputation of Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? How does it follow, that becauſe</hi> Abraham <hi>was juſtified by ſuch noble and generous acts of Faith; therefore we ſhould be juſtified by imputed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by rowling our ſouls on Christ? Theſe two Faiths are of as different kinds, as can be imagined; we cannot reaſon from the one to the other: The difference between the Faith of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>and the Faith of Chriſtans is this;</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and this is counted to us for righteouſneſs:</hi> Abraham <hi>believed the Revelations God made to him; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57359:190"/>the Revelations God hath made to to us by his Son,</hi> Heb. 1.1. <hi>So that the firſt notion of Faith in Chriſt, is a firm belief of his divine Authority; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily draws after it a belief of the whole doctrine of the Goſpel: Thus</hi> Joh. 20.31. <hi>The Chriſtian Faith is deſcribed by believing</hi> that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God: <hi>And</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.5.

Doth it follow, becauſe</hi> Abraham <hi>was juſtified by ſuch generous acts, that we ſhould be juſtified by imputed Righteouſneſs?</hi> But I muſt aſſert, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> truſted in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſo Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs (though, ſuppoſe, unknown to them in ſuch a clear manner as it is to us) was imputed to them; And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without it, I ſee not how they ſhould have (which, no doubt, they wanted) remiſſion in Chriſt's Blood. But (ſaith the Author) <hi>The firſt notion of Faith in Chriſt is a firm belief of his Authority; the Chriſtian Faith is deſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by believing, that Jeſus is the Son of God, the very Christ,</hi> Joh. 20.31. <hi>and</hi> 1 Joh. 5.5. <hi>that is, that he came from God with full authority to declare his

See here, a Righteouſneſs, and that exceeding a Phariſaical one, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theirs. The Apoſtle excludes <hi>the righteouſneſs which is of the Law:</hi> In the 7. Verſe he had ſhut out the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law taken in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical ſence; but in the 9. Verſe he goes on, and puts by the Righteouſneſs of the Law taken in its own ſpiritual
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57359:196"/>Nature, the Righteouſneſs which the Law in its holy Commands preſcribes; and ſurely the Law calls for internal Holineſs, as well as external Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. In another place the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That by the works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be justified,</hi> Gal. 2.16. No fleſh, not the holieſt Saint on earth (whoſe Righteouſneſs is as much above the Phariſees as Life is above pictures and ſhadows) ſhall be juſtified by his own Righteouſneſs or conformity to the Law. But if the Apoſtle would not have his own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, in Juſtification, what would he have? He would have <hi>the righteouſneſs which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith:</hi> He doth not ſay, a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is Faith or other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but <hi>a righteouſneſs which is through the faith of Christ, a righteouſneſs which is of God by faith:</hi> Now inherent Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are never in Scripture called the Righteouſneſs of God; <hi>The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is upon thoſe that believe,</hi> Rom. 3.22. not in them, as inherent Graces are: <hi>The righteouſneſs of God is in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. not in our ſelves, as our Graces are: <hi>The righteouſneſs of God is</hi> one and the ſame with <hi>the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57359:196"/>righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1. not the ſame with our Graces: The Apoſtle therefore would have, <hi>the righteouſneſs which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith;</hi> that is, the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which Faith receives, and God accepts on our behalf. By theſe things it appears, that the Apoſtle in this place doth not only exclude external Phariſaical Righteouſneſs, but even inherent Graces in the matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>

                     <hi>How can Imputation come in here? What pretty ſence would this make of the Apostle's Argument? The Law was too weak to make men throughly good, to conquer their ſin, reform their hearts and lives, therefore God ſent his Son into the world; What for? to give them better Laws, more excellent Promiſes, and more powerful aſſiſtances to do good? No, by no means; but to fulfil all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for them, that they may fulfil the Righteouſneſs of the Law, not by doing any thing themſelves, but by having all done for them, by having Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs imputed to them: There was no reaſon to abrogate the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>for this end, it might have continued in force ſtill, and have been as available to Salvation as the Goſpel is, with the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental Righteouſneſs of Christ; but the weakneſs of the Law, the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, was not the want of an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs (which might have been had as well under the Law as under the Goſpel, if God had pleaſed;) but a want of ſtrength and power to ſubdue the ſinful appetites of men:</hi> It was weak through the fleſh; <hi>by the prevalency of luſts, which the Law could not conquer; therefore the Goſpel must ſupply this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not by imputed Righteouſneſs, but by

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57359:201"/>us: Chriſt bore the wrath of God for us, and (theſe things being imputed unto us) the Righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in us: But then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle returns again to Sanctification, and ſubjoyns, <hi>Who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit;</hi> aſſuring us, that thoſe who are juſtified by the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, are alſo San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and led by his holy Spirit: This I take to be the meaning of the place: But let us hear our Church treating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place in conjunction with other Scriptures:<note place="margin">

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57359:201"/>or the price of our redemption, by the offering of his body, and ſhedding of his Blood with fulfilling of the Law perfectly and throughly; and upon our part true and lively Faith in the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, which yet is not ours, but by Gods working in us: So that in our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not only Gods Mercy and Grace, but alſo his Juſtice, which the Apoſtle call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Justice of God, and it conſiſteth in paying our ranſom, and fulfilling of the Law: And ſo the Grace of God doth not ſhut out the Justice of God in our Juſtification, but only ſhutteth out the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of man; that is to ſay, the juſtice of our works, as to be merits of deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our juſtification. And therefore St.</hi> Paul <hi>declareth here nothing upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of man, concerning his justification, but only a true lively Faith, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs is the gift of God, and not man's only work without God; and yet that Faith doth not ſhut out Repentance, Hope, Love, Dread, and the fear of God to be joyned with Faith in every man that is juſtified, but it ſhutteth them out from the office of juſtifying; ſo that although they be all preſent in him that is juſtified; yet they justifie not all together.</hi> Theſe are the excellent words of our Church, worthy (without flattery be it ſpoken)
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57359:202"/>to be written in Letters of Gold, but much more in the hearts of all true Chriſtians: We ſee here, that there is in juſtification nothing on the behalf of man but Faith only; no, internal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Repentance, Hope, Love, Fear of God, are in the juſtified, but ſhut out from the office of juſtifying: God's Grace, and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs are the great cauſes of juſtification: But ſaith the Author, <hi>Is there here any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation thereof?</hi> I anſwer, Our Church ſurely thought ſo, and we have his paſſive Righteouſneſs expreſſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. and where that is expreſſed, the active is implied: This is clear, when the Scripture ſaith, That <hi>we are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by Chriſt's obedience,</hi> Rom. 5.19.

All the Jews were not Phariſees, nor did they ſtick meerly in the Letter or husk of external Righteouſneſs; the Scribe could ſay, That <hi>the love of God with all the heart, was more than all burnt-offerings
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57359:211"/>and ſacrifices,</hi> Mark 12.33. and ſome Jewiſh Rabbins ſay, <hi>That the heart of man anſwers to the holy place; there a place muſt be made for the</hi> Sheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, <hi>the divine Majesty to dwell in, and it muſt be the holy of Holies.</hi> No queſtion the Jews, at leaſt ſome of them, did know, that there muſt be ſome inward Sanctity; but ſtill they ſtuck in their own Righteouſneſs, they would not ſubmit to be juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of another. Our inherent Graces, as before I noted, are called our own in Scripture, but never the Righteouſneſs of God; that is not our own but anothers, that is, Chriſt's, and made ours only by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. <hi>Iſrael followed after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but attained not to the Law of righteouſneſs; wherefore? Becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but, as it were, by the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9.31. they attained not to the Law of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Had the Righteouſneſs of the Law been only an external one, they might have reached it; but the Law called for all Righteouſneſs and that in pure ſinleſs perfection, and that they attained not, becauſe they ſought it not in Chriſt, in whom perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is, but in themſelves, where
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57359:212"/>it could not be found: But to go on, <hi>God never deſigned that any man ſhould be justified to eternal life, by obſerving the Law of</hi> Moſes: So the Author: Its true, God never intended to juſtifie us fallen Creatures by our own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or by the Righteouſneſs of the Law performed by us: But if (as the Author told us before) Abel <hi>and</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch <hi>were juſtified by a belief of the Principles of natural Religion: If</hi> Noah <hi>was juſtified by believing the Deluge; if</hi> Abraham <hi>was juſtified by believing the particular Revelations made to him,</hi> why might not the Jews be juſtified by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> Abraham <hi>and all the good men in thoſe days were juſtified by ſuch a firm belief of the Being and Providence of God, and the partcular Revelations made to them, as made them careful in all things to pleaſe God:</hi> Thus the Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 255. Why might not Jews before the Incarnation of Chriſt be juſtified by ſuch a firm belief of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as made them careful to pleaſe God? The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Revelation too, in its Morals point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a perfect Sanctity and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and in its Typicals aiming at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the body and ſubſtance of them all.</p>

The whole Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> is a divine Ditty; which, under the parable of Marriage, ſtreams all along, as a full torrent of Spiritual Love interchangeably paſſing between Chriſt and his Church: Well might the Doctor bring his proof from thence: Chriſt calls his Spouſe <hi>all fair,</hi> and <hi>without ſpot,</hi> Cant. 4.7. She was not ſo
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:57359:216"/>naturally, but by Marriage; neither is ſhe ſo in this life by inherent Graces; but by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt put upon her by a gracious imputation: Chriſt calls her <hi>from Lebanon, from the top of Amana, Shenir, and Hermon, from the lyons dens, from the mountains of the Leopards,</hi> verſ. 8. That is, from the brutiſh luſts and idolatries of the World; and he calls her thus: <hi>Come with me, with me, my Spouſe,</hi> as if he had ſaid, that he would provide for her as a Spouſe; and therefore ſhe ſhould come away with him: But, ſaith the Author, <hi>Perſonal virtues in the Husband were never ſettled on the Wife for a Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by our Marriage to Chriſt; his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal excellencies cannot be made over to us.</hi> To which, I anſwer, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt cannot be made ours, ſo as to inhere in us: But it may be made ours by imputation; or if not, neither can his blood be imputed to us; and by conſequence there can be no ſuch thing as ſatisfaction or redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through his Blood: But for the truth of imputed Righteouſneſs, theſe men deſire to appeal no further than the Articles or Marriage Covenant contained in the Goſpel, beyond this they deſire to claim nothing from
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:57359:216"/>Chriſt their Husband and Saviour? But, ſaith the Author, <hi>A woman under covert is not liable to debts, but ſhe is to crimes.</hi> I anſwer, Our debts are crimes, and that above Felonies; they are High-treaſons againſt the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and if theſe fall not on our Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Chriſt, they muſt fall upon us; and then who, where is the man that can ſtand before the Divine Tribunal?

                     </gap>, or Surety, he ſtruck hands with God (as the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) put himſelf into their ſtead, took their debt upon himſelf, and bound himſelf upon this account to make ſatisfaction to God. Now in the Law the debtor and ſurety are but one perſon; the Law looks on them as one, and makes no difference between them; and therefore both are equally liable to the debt; and if the one pay, it is as much in the eye of the Law, as if the other had paid it: Thus it is with Chriſt and us; he is our Surety, he took our debt upon himſelf, engaged to pay what we owed; upon this Chriſt and we are but one perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and accordingly he deals with us; for he makes over our ſins to Chriſt, and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Satisfaction to us, he now, in a legal notion, looks upon both but as one perſon: <hi>Now I have two things to ſay to this: Firſt, I wonder why this ſhould be called the union of Saints to Christ? Or why Chriſt ſhould be called only the Saints Surety? The Apoſtle tells us, that he is</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. The Surety of a Teſtament or Covenant: <hi>Now there is a vaſt difference between
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57359:217"/>Chriſt's being the Saints ſurety, and the ſurety of the Covenant; for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reſpects both Saints and Sinners; therefore is antecedent to our union to Chriſt as Saints; and to be ſurety of the Covenant, ſignifies no more but to confirm this Covenant, and to undertake for the performance of it, that all the promiſes of it ſhall be made good upon ſuch terms as are annexed to them: But to be a Surety for Saints (as the Doctor explains it) is</hi> to ſtrike hands with God, to put himſelf in their ſtead to do and ſuffer for them. <hi>Now this notion is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the notion of a Surety of a Covenant, and ſo it wants ſome better proof. But ſecondly, ſuppoſe Chriſt had been called</hi> the Saints ſurety: <hi>I doubt they are as much out in the Law of ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip, as they were before in the Laws of Marriage: For, firſt, the prime end of ſuretiſhip among men, is not that the Surety, ſhall without more ado pay the debt: but to give ſecurity to the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that the debt ſhall be paid; that is, the Surety doth not make himſelf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Debtor; but the Debtor is Debtor ſtill, and bound to pay the Debt; and the Surety is liable only in caſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault: It is a ſtrange definition of ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip,</hi> That it is an abſolute taking
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57359:218"/>the debt upon our ſelves, and an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſcharging the Debtor. <hi>No man in his wits ever became ſurety for another, when he knew before hand; that, if he did, he must pay the debt: but men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſureties upon reaſonable aſſurance, that they ſhall ſuffer no injury by it: Therefore when Christ died for us, he did not dye as our Surety, but as our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſubſtituted in our room, which is the Scripture notion of it, and differs as much from the notion of a ſurety; as paying the debt doth from being bound with another, that it ſhall be paid: Suppoſe, ſecondly, That Chriſt dyed for us as our Surety; yet did Christ fulfill all Righteouſneſs for us as our ſurety too? Doth this alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly anſwer the caſe of ſuretiſhip among men, ſo as that there needs no illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it? The Doctor was ſo wiſe, that he would not aſſert this in the premiſſes, but very craftily thrusts it into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion;</hi> That therefore God makes over our ſins to Chriſt, and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and ſatisfaction to us: <hi>But was there ever ſuch a ſurety heard of among men, that one man ſhould diſcharge all offices of piety, virtue, juſtice, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance inſtead of another? If ſuch a thing had ever been, ſuch a man ought not to have been called a ſurety, but a proxy:
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57359:218"/>But humane Laws, as many defects as there are in them, never admitted of ſuch proxies; for theſe are perſonal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which none can perform for us; you may as well ſay, that a man may live and be a man by proxy, as diſcharge thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are neceſſarily entailed on his perſon by a proxy. Proxies are allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only in ſuch caſes, where the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al enquiry is, whether the thing be done, not who doth it; but where the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſon that doth it, is eſſential to the action; there is no place for a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or proxy: becauſe it doth not ſatisfie the Law, that the thing is done, unleſs it be done by ſuch a perſon. Thus it is in all the duties of Piety and Religion; every individual perſon is bound to do them: Though there were never ſo many righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men in the World, there righteouſneſs can avail none but themſelves; Nay, the righteouſneſs of God, which is more than all the righteouſneſs of men cannot make an unrighteous man righteous; no exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Relation can make the righteouſneſs of another ours; becauſe it is perſonal righteouſneſs, that is required of us, and the righteouſneſs of another can never be our perſonal righteouſneſs, unleſs we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one perſon with him: There is no other way to make the perſonal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

And theſe things he would never have done, unleſs he had taken them upon himſelf as our Surety; he ſaith of himſelf, that he came <hi>to give his life a ranſom for many,</hi> Matth. 20.28. He came for that end, as being bound by his ſuretiſhip ſo to do: He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Surety, as well as the Surety of the Covenant: Nay, it being plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the divine pleaſure, that <hi>there ſhould be no remiſſion without ſhedding of blood,</hi> that all pardoning mercy ſhould iſſue out to us through a ſatisfaction; unleſs he had been our Surety, unleſs he had undertaken to ſatisfie for us, he could not have been Surety of the Covenant; he could not have ſecured the leaſt Grace or Mercy to us, more than to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; for whom he would not be ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or make any ſatisfaction: Now

But poſſibly Dr. <hi>Jacomb</hi> may ſpeak of the Saints, becauſe the Payment or Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt hath a ſpecial aſpect upon the Elect or choſen people of God, and is particularly applied to Believers and Saints; whileſt in the mean time to others, who receive not the Atonement, it is totally ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and in the event, as it were, none at all: But, ſaith the Author, <hi>I doubt theſe men are as much out in the Law of Suretiſhip, as before in the Laws of Mariage:</hi> To which I only ſay, I hope they are out in neither. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the Authors Objections, I ſhall crave lieve to offer one thing to the Readers conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Titles given to Chriſt in Scripture, are all to be taken <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in a way of tranſcendent Excellency and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, not according to the narrow Scantling of humane Laws or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Chriſt is a Sacrifice, but when did you ever hear of a Sacrifice that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up it ſelf, or of a Sacrifice and Prieſt both in one? Or when was there a Sacrifice that was offered up through
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57359:220"/>the eternal Spirit, or that had ſuch an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar as the Deity? Chriſt is a Redeemer, but when was there a Redeemer who paid down himſelf as a Price, and, which is more, paid down himſelf to himſelf? For ſo Chriſt as God-man paid down his humane Nature to himſelf as God. Chriſt is a Mediator, and where is there a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, who hath two Natures in one Perſon, or who gave himſelf a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for all? And to name but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance more, Chriſt is a Surety for us; but where was there a Surety ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the Creditor only? Or a Surety, who took another Nature to be ſuch in? Chriſt is a Surety of the Covenant, where there is ſomething on Gods part, and ſomething on Man's; and who ever heard, that in Articles of agreement, or reciprocal Covenants between Man and Man, any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Surety for a performance of both parts or ſides of the Covenants? Theſe things plainly ſhew, that Chriſt is all theſe in a way of Eminency or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency: So that, unleſs we will be ſo bold as to ſpoil him of the glory and excellency of his Titles, we muſt by no means crowd them into the Span of humane Laws or Reaſon. This, if conſidered, will prepare a way to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57359:221"/>the Authors Objections, which are now to be heard: <hi>The Surety doth not make himſelf immediate Debtor, he doth not abſolutely take the debt upon himſelf; he is liable only in caſe of the Debtors default: No man in his wits would be Surety for another, when he knew beforehand, that, if he did, he must pay the debt: Men become Sureties upon aſſurance not to ſuffer injury by it:</hi> Thus the Author: To which I anſwer, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are uſually bound to pay in caſe of the Debtors default, but it is not at all material or eſſential to Suretiſhip, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Debtor be ſolvent or not; it is not the Debtors ſufficiency, but the Sureties own Act, which makes him a Surety; neither can a Surety, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, plead this in Law, that the Debtor was a Non ſolvent at the time when he became Surety: But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be with Sureties among men, Jeſus Chriſt was a Surety after another rate than they are: Sureties among men undertake to pay the debt upon a meer contingency, that is, if the Debtor make default; but Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſatisfie for us, not upon contingency, but certainty: he was delivered <gap reason="foreign">

A Redeemer, we know, doth not depend on the Captive for paying the Ranſom, but abſolutely undertakes it himſelf; and ſo did Chriſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for us: And if as Redeemer he abſolutely undertook to pay down his Blood for a price of Redemption, then as a Surety too, he abſolutely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:57359:222"/>to pay down the ſame Blood for ſatisfaction; otherwiſe his Redeemerſhip and Suretiſhip could not poſſibly conſiſt together. <hi>Sureties uſe to have aſſurance to ſave them harmleſs:</hi> But had Chriſt any?

Nay, if if he could, he would not; when <hi>Peter</hi> would have had him ſpare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he calls <hi>Peter, Satan,</hi> one who in that particular ſavoured not the things of God. Thus we ſee, Chriſt is a Surety in a way of Excellency above humane Sureties. But ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>Chriſt died for us, not as our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but as our Sacrifice:</hi> To which I anſwer, Chriſt died for us as a Sacrifice, but he died for us as a Surety too; no one Notion can take in all the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of his Death: Though the Eſſentials of his Suretiſhip lay in his undertaking to ſatisfie for us, yet the Satisfaction it ſelf was a juſt neceſſary conſequent of it: As he offered up himſelf for us, ſo he died for us as a Sacrifice; and as he undertook to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for us, ſo he died for us as a Surety.
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:57359:222"/>But to paſs on with the Author: <hi>If Christ died for us as a Surety, yet did he fulfil all Righteouſneſs for us as a Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty too? Was there ever ſuch a Surety heard of among men, that one man ſhould diſcharge all Offices of Piety, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Juſtice, Temperance in ſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? Such a man muſt have been call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a Surety, but a Proxy; but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws admit no ſuch Proxies; theſe are perſonal Duties, which none can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form for us; no external Relation can make the Righteouſneſs of another ours; the Righteouſneſs of another can never be our perſonal Righteouſneſs, unleſs we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one perſon with him:</hi> Thus the Author: To which I anſwer; Here the Author makes a great wonder at Imputed Righteouſneſs; <hi>Was there ever ſuch a Surety heard of among men?</hi> ſaith he: To which I anſwer, <hi>Socinus</hi> makes as great a wonder at the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſin to Chriſt: <hi>Ego ſanè non video quid abſurdius aut iniquius dici potuerit, quàmjure alicui poſſe ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena peccata imputari; I ſee nothing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>more abſurd or unequal than that the ſins of one man ſhould be imputed to another:</hi> Yet for all this our Divines do maintain, that our ſins were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Chriſt; and indeed there can
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:57359:223"/>be no Satisfaction without it. The Author here complains, that Chriſt ſhould be a Surety to fulfil all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for us, and ſo that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be imputed to us; but if the ſin of one man may be imputed to another, why not his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? The Apoſtle argues from the Imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; <hi>As by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; ſo by the righteouſneſs of one the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life: As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5.18, 19.

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:57359:223"/>eſtate; he fulfilled all Righteouſneſs for us to the very higheſt pitch of the Law, in order to our Juſtification, and that we could not reach in our own perſons; and that ſincere Obedience which we pay in our own perſons doth not fully anſwer the Law, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains not to our Juſtification, but Sanctification: And this I take to be the Method of Salvation which God hath chalked out to us. It's true, the Author urges, <hi>That the Righteouſneſs of another can never be our perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:</hi> But though it cannot be ours by Inheſion, yet it may by Imputation; it was only in Chriſt's Perſon, yet may be reckoned or accounted to us in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or elſe I cannot tell, how the Blood of Chriſt, which cleanſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all ſin, ſhould ever be ours; that was not inherent in us, and, if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ours, it muſt be by Imputation: If we own not the Imputation of Chriſts Paſſive Obedience, we cannot own, that Chriſt gave himſelf for us as a Ranſom or a Sacrifice; and if we own the Imputation of his Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we muſt alſo own the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Active; for there was, not to ſay a tincture, but a great, and high meaſure of Active Obedience in his

                     <hi>whether in Law the Debtor and Surety are one perſon; no conſidering man can think it indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, who pays the debt, the Surety or the Debtor, or that they are both equally obliged to it; the Debtor is the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Debtor ſtill, and the Surety only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in caſe of default, the Law doth not account it indifferent which of them pay it: For though it permit the payment to be exacted from the Surety, in caſe the Debtor refuſe, yet it will look back again, and allow the ſurety an action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the debtor for ſuch a refuſal, which is an Argument that the Law doth not judge them one perſon: Thus it is in bail, the Law doth not judge them one perſon, for if the priſoner eſcape, the bail or ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall be puniſhed according to the nature of the fact; and yet the priſoner is not quitted by this means, but liable either to the arreſt of the Surety; or in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſes to the Sentence of the Law, if ever he be retaken. Thus in Sureties for good behaviour (which ſounds as if it were neareſt a kin to the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as our Surety)
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:57359:224"/>though the Surety be never ſo innocent and virtuous, this will not ſerve him for whom he is Surety; but if he prove a Villain they ſhall be both puniſh'd: So that humane Laws are ſtrangers to this Mystery of imputing the Righteouſneſs of a Surety to a bad man; Suretiſhip doth not ſo unite their Perſons, that whatever one doth, is always and to all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes imputed to the other: And if this will not hold good among men, it is a very ſorry foundation for this bargain and exchange betwixt Chriſt and Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that he ſhould take their ſins upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and impute his Righteouſneſs to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this runs upon a miſtake,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> that Chriſt cannot be a Surety, unleſs he be ſuch after the manner of men; the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſhip of Chriſt is not to be meaſured by humane Laws, unto which (becauſe variant among themſelves no leſs, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in points of Suretyſhip than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things) it cannot poſſibly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond; but it is to be meaſured by the holy Scriptures, which ſet forth his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking and ſatisfying our debts in a way of ſuperlative Excellency above all the Sureties in the world. Among men, <hi>notwithſtanding the Surety, the Debtor is Debtor ſtill:</hi> But Chriſt hath
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:57359:225"/>as our Surety made ſuch a plenary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction on our behalf, that if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him by Faith, we are Debtors no longer, all our debts are croſſed and blotted out of Gods Book. <hi>Among men the Surety, having made payment, may have his Action against the Debtor,</hi> and ordinarily he ſeeks to reimburſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; But our heavenly Surety ſeeks no ſuch matter; he knows, that all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth are not able to repay him what he hath laid down for us, neither if they could, doth he deſire it; but on the contrary he woes and beſeechs men to come in to him, that their Debts may not be charged on them by the Law for want of imbracing the Goſpel. <hi>If upon the eſcape of the Priſoner, the Bail be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet is not the Priſoner quitted:</hi> But our Surety Chriſt, did not ſuffer as a Bail doth upon eſcape, upon accident or contingency, but upon abſolute and irrevocable certainty, ſuch as could not be avoided, and he ſuffered ſo in our room and ſtead; and his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is ſo far reckoned or imputed to us, that upon our believing there is not, there cannot be any condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to us, or ſatisfaction required of us for ever. <hi>In Suretiſhip for the Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:57359:225"/>the Virtues of the Surety are not accounted to him for whom he is Surety:</hi> But the Payment and Satisfaction of Chriſt our Surety is upon Goſpel-terms ſo imputed and made over to us, that the Law or Juſtice of God cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſecond Payment and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from us: Hence it appears, that Chriſt and we are one perſon in Law, that his Payment and Satisfaction is reckoned as ours. And what matters it, if humane Laws are ſtrangers to imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, it ſuffices us, that this Myſtery is founded on the holy Scripture. When the Romans would have no other Gods, but what were approved of by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells them, <hi>Apud vos de humano arbitratu Divinitas penſitatur;</hi>

                     <hi>whether the Notion of a Mediator can do any better ſervice than the Notion of a Surety. Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>ſaith,</hi> That Chriſt fulfilled all Righteouſneſs as he was Mediator, and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did as Mediator, he did it for them whoſe Mediator he was, and in whoſe ſtead, and for whoſe good he executed the Office of a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:57359:226"/>God; and hence is it that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and perfect Obedience to the Law is reckoned to us: <hi>But that Chriſt fulfilled all Righteouſneſs as he was Mediator must have good proof, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Mediator includes no ſuch thing. A Mediator is one who interpoſes between two differing parties; but was it ever heard of yet, that it was the Office of a Mediator to perform the Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions himſelf:</hi> Moſes was the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the firſt Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. <hi>and his Office was to receive the Law from God, and to deliver it to the people, and to command them to obſerve the Rites and Sacrifices and Expiations, which God had ordained; but he was not to fulfil the Righteouſneſs of the Law for the whole Congregation: Thus Chriſt is now</hi> the Mediator of a better Covenant, <hi>and his Office required, that he ſhould preach the Goſpel, which contains the Terms of peace between God and men; and ſince God would not enter into Covenant with ſinners without the intervention of a Sacrifice; he dies too as a Sacrifice and Propitiation for the ſins of the World, and confirms and ſeals this new Covenant with his own Blood; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riſen from the dead, he executes this Office of Mediator with power and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:57359:226"/>glory, that is, he intercedes for us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Terms and Conditions of the new Covenant, to obtain the pardon of our ſins, and the aſſiſtance of the divine Grace to do the Will of God, and all thoſe other bleſſings that are promiſed: But the Office of Mediator doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to fulfil the Righteouſneſs of the Covenant for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is a Mediator but in a ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent way; a Mediator,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> but above all Peers or Parallels: Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, that <hi>there is one Mediator between God and men the man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>One Mediator; Moſes</hi> was a Mediator too, but, becauſe Chriſt was a Mediator in a peculiar and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perexcellent manner, there is but one Mediator. <hi>Moſes</hi> was an internuncial Mediator; but Chriſt was a ſatisfying and atoning one: Hence it appears, that the Mediatorſhip of Chriſt muſt not be meaſured by the Mediatorſhip of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> or any other perſon in the world, but muſt be conſtrued according to thoſe ſingular Excellencies and Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies which the Scripture attributes to it: The Apoſtle tells us what a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator he was; <hi>He gave his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for all;</hi> and, as I noted before, where his Paſſive Obedience is expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:57359:227"/>there the active is implyed: Chriſt was a Mediator in that, which he did for us; and on our behalf, and for us, and on our behalf he fulfilled all Righteouſneſs: This is evident; that of Chriſts which is imputed, and applyed to us to juſtifie and make us Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, was done for us, and and on our behalf; and ſuch was his fulfilling all Righteouſneſs. Hence the Apoſtle tells us; <hi>That by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life, and by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5.18, 19. <hi>Moſes</hi> was not to fulfill the righteouſneſs of the Law for the people, nor was he to dye as a propitiatory Sacrifice for them, but Chriſt, a more excellent Mediator, did both for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>first tells of</hi> an habitual Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,<note place="margin">

We find in Scripture, that at the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Sacrifices there was a confeſſion of ſin, the form of which, as their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſay, was thus; <hi>O Lord, thy people, the houſe of Iſrael, they have ſinned, they have done wickedly, &amp;c.</hi> and might an innocent Iſraelite (had there been ſuch an one) have joyned in this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that without the forfeiture of his innocency? I doubt he could not: Beſides, when the Scripture aſſigns no ſuch reaſon for Chriſt's ſubjection to any Law, who may be ſo bold as to do it? But, ſaith the Author, <hi>Chriſt's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Ceremonial Law juſtifieth no man;</hi> Neither according to the Author doth his Obedience to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law; and therefore he might have left his Obedience, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleature of all divine Laws, undivided and in its entirety.</p>

                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</note> There can be no other reaſon aſſigned of Chriſt's Obedience to the Law of God, but only this, that he did it in our ſtead: <hi>Now this Argument would be good, were it true and were there not a great many things done, which we cannot aſſign the reaſon of, and yet done for great and weighty reaſons; but this reaſon is ſufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was as much bound to it as any other man. The Dr takes it for granted,</hi> That if Chriſt were not bound to obey theſe Laws upon his own account, it muſt be either for us, or to fit him for his Death and Oblation; but it was not to fit him for his Death, therefore it was for us: <hi>He tells us,</hi> that he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all Types, and was every way fit to be made an offering for ſin by his Union and habitual Grace: If his Obedience were not for us, and upon our account, there is no juſt cauſe to be aſſigned, why he ſhould live here in the world ſo long as he did in perfect obedience to all the Laws of God. Had he died before, there had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Innocence and perfect Holineſs by his habitual Grace, and infinite Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Worth from the dignity of his Perſon; and ſurely he yielded not that long courſe of Obedience but for
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:57359:236"/>ſome great and ſpecial purpoſes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our Salvation: <hi>Yes truly; but muſt this needs be his actual ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling all Righteouſneſs for us? What do you think of his preaching the Goſpel throughout all</hi> Judea <hi>which would take up ſome time? What of the many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which confirmed his Doctrine? What of training up his Apoſtles to ſucceed him in his Miniſtry as Eye-witneſſes and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes of his Miracles and Doctrine? What of the holy Example of his Life, which was no leſs neceſſary than his Laws? Theſe are all great and ſpecial purpoſes in reference to our Salvation, though we ſhould ſuppoſe him fit to have been a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Herod <hi>deſigned he ſhould have been</hi>) <hi>as ſoon as he were born; though by the way, I think he could not have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Types and Predictions of him, had he dyed ſo ſoon, notwithſtanding his perfect innocence and holineſs.</hi>

                     <hi>That the end of Chriſt's Active Obedience could not be aſſigned to be, that he might be fitted for his death and oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that becauſe be was every way fit to be made an offering for ſin, by his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and habitual Grace;</hi> the Dr. intended not, that Chriſt lived here ſo long, only that he might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:57359:236"/>and for no other ends: It's true that Chriſt lived here ſo long, that he might preach, and do Miracles, and inſtruct his Apoſtles, and it's true, that he lived here ſo long, that he might fulfil all Righteouſneſs, all theſe were ends of his living here; but the <hi>Quaere</hi> is, What was the end of his Active O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? I never yet read, that the end of that was his preaching, doing of Miracles, or inſtructing his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; theſe were ſimultaneous and concurrent in time with his Obedience. But <hi>Christ obeyed the Law, that he might give us an holy Example by his Life:</hi> I grant it, but that was not all; Chriſt died alſo for to leave an Example to us, but there was much more in his Death; in truth both were for our Juſtification: As <hi>we are justified by his blood,</hi> Rom. 5.9. ſo <hi>we are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by his obedience,</hi> ver. 9.</p>

                     <hi>that Christ fulfilled all Righteouſneſs for us, is from the abſolute neceſſity of it:</hi> For this is the Term of the Covenant, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> Life is not to be obtained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all be done that the Law requires; we being unable to do this, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Chriſt our Mediator and Surety ſhould fulfil the Law for us:
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:57359:237"/>
                     <hi>This Argument is to prove that it ought to be ſo, not that it is ſo; but we muſt not preſcribe methods to God. The ſum of the Argument is, that there never was, nor never can be a Covenant of Grace; that God ſtill exacts the rigorous perfection of the Law from us; that we muſt not appear before him without a complete and perfect Righteouſneſs of our own or of another: Now this is the thing in queſtion, Whether we muſt be made righteous with the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, or whether God will for the ſake of Christ diſpenſe with the rigor of the Law, and accept of a ſincere and Evangelical Obedience in ſtead of a perfect and unſinning Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; ſo that he only confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms what was in diſpute, and this goes for an Argument.</hi>

                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Nor may we deny thoſe he hath ſet down and reveiled to us. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, that Juſtification under the Goſpel is in a way completive and perfective of the Law, ſo that the Law is eſtabliſhed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. and hath its end or complement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. and this cannot be without a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs: And withal the Scripture tells us where that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:57359:237"/>is, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to us,</hi> Rom. 10.4. and, <hi>We are made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is made ours by Imputation, &amp; that anſwers the Law in every point. But then (ſaith the Author) <hi>there can be no covenant of Grace:</hi> If the perfect Righteouſneſs were to be done by us in our own perſons, there could be none indeed; but may there be none, if that Righteouſneſs be fulfilled by Chriſt and imputed to us? The Papiſts uſe to blaſt imputed Righteouſneſs with many ugly names, as if it were putative, an imaginary Fiction, a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrum</hi> of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Brain, and the like; but I never before heard, that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, made ours by Imputation, did overthrow the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace: Sure the Paſſive Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt doth not overthrow it, and, if the Active be joyned with that as it ought, no evil can enſue; but we may in the conjunction of both as in a Glaſs ſee the admirable Wiſdom of God, which hath framed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace in ſuch a manner, that we, who have no perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own, are yet juſtified by the complete Righteouſneſs of Chriſt
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:57359:238"/>our Surety; ſo that the Law, though not fulfilled by us, hath its perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion. It's true, that God accepts of our ſincere Obedience, but not in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; not in the room of Chriſt's perfect Righteouſneſs, but in its own proper place, having its defects cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>

But the truth is, this,</hi> us, <hi>is not in the text, it is not to redeem</hi> us, <hi>but to redeem</hi> them <hi>that were under the Law, that is, the Jews, who were in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under the Moſaical Law; from which Chriſt redeemed them by abrogating that Law, and introducing a better covenant,</hi> the adoption of ſons: <hi>For in this Epiſtle, nay in this chapter, the Law is called a ſtate</hi> of ſervants, <hi>and of</hi> an heir under
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:57359:239"/>age, <hi>but the Goſpel is</hi> the adoption of ſons, <hi>puts us into ſuch a free and manly ſtate, as that of an heir at age, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called</hi> the Spirit of Adoption, Rom. 8.15. <hi>So that the meaning of this Text is this, that God hath put an end to the diſpenſation of the Law, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> redeeming them that are under the Law, <hi>in a ſtate of ſervitude and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and hath eſtabliſhed a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the room of it, which as much exceeds the Law as the adoption of Sons doth the ſtate of Servants; and this God brought to paſs by</hi> ſending his Son made of a woman, made under the Law: <hi>For the underſtanding of which words we must conſider, what influence Christ's appearing in the world had on the abrogation of the Law, and that was, that he accompliſhed all the Types and Figures of the Law in his own Perſon; and when all thoſe Types were fulfilled, they grew out of date: So that his</hi> being made under the Law <hi>moſt probably ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies his being made ſuch a Perſon, as ſhould exactly anſwer all the Types and Figures of the Law, and ſo to put an end to it, as of no further uſe: Thus the Temple was</hi> God's Houſe, <hi>but now the</hi> Shechinah <hi>or divine Glory rested on Chriſt: When Christ the great High-Prieſt

Or is he not their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer within this Text? Yes, ſurely, obſerve the words of the Apoſtle; <hi>To redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> The Apoſtle alters his phraſe, and turns <hi>them</hi> into, <hi>we,</hi> which takes in the <hi>Galatians</hi> into the adoption; and by conſequence into the redemption too; and to make it more clear, he alters his phraſe again, and turns <hi>we</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>ye;</hi> in the next verſe which hangs upon the former: <hi>And becauſe ye are ſons,</hi> verſ. 6. ye <hi>Galatians,</hi> ye Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are ſons; and ye <hi>Galatians,</hi> ye Gentiles, are redeemed ones within the Text: Otherwiſe, which is very ſtrange, the Apoſtle ſhould argue from the Redemption of the Jews only, to the Adoption of the Gentiles: But to go on, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>redeemed the Jews from the bondage of the Moſaical Law</hi> (that is, I ſuppoſe, the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:57359:240"/>Ceremonial Law) <hi>and introduced a better Covenant, the adoption of ſons.</hi> To which I anſwer, Chriſt did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed redeem from the bondage of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Rites and Ceremonies: But is this all the Redemption within the Text?

Our Saviour was never made under the whole Law to redeem from a part of it only. Again, Redemption from the Ceremonial Law was peculiar to the Jews: But the Redemption here ſpoken of reaches as far as the Gentiles alſo; who, as I before noted, have a ſhare in the Adoption of Sons, as well as the Jews: The Redemption here ſpoken of, is not a part or piece of
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:57359:241"/>Redemption, but Redemption in its fulneſs and excellency. Chriſt by coming into the fleſh, introduceth a better Covenant; that is, the beams of Evangelical Light were purer, and the effuſions of the holy Spirit larger than before: But ſtill we muſt remember, that the Covenant of Grace was for ſubſtance, one and the ſame under both Teſtaments: Under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, true Believers had the Law in their heart, the Adoption of Sons, the free Spirit, and a true title to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life: And on the other hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament, unbelievers have the Law and Goſpel too, but in the Letter; their bondage is far greater than that of beggarly Elements: The unclean ſpirit dwells and works in them; and the dreadful wrath of God abideth on them. <hi>Chriſt's being under the Law,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>is his being ſuch a perſon, as ſhould exactly anſwer all the Types and Figures of the Law:</hi> Unto which I add: His being under the Law, is his being ſuch a perſon, as ſhould exactly anſwer all the demands of the Moral Law, in its mandatory and minatory parts.</p>

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:57359:241"/>Righteouſneſs of his life have upon our acceptance with God: And all that I can find in Scripture about this, is, that to this we owe the Covenant of Grace, that God being well pleaſed with the obedience of Chriſt's Life, and the ſacrifice of his Death; for his ſake entred into a new Covenant with mankind; wherein he promſes pardon of ſin and eternal life to thoſe who believe and obey the Goſpel: This is very plain with reference to Chriſt's death. Hence the Blood of Chriſt is called</hi> the blood of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>And Chriſt is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> the great Shepherd and Biſhop of ſouls, through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. <hi>And the Blood of Christ is called,</hi> the blood of ſprinkling, which ſpeaks better things than the blood of Abel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. <hi>which is an alluſion to</hi> Moſes, <hi>his ſprinkling the blood of the Sacrifice, whereby he confirmed the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the children of</hi> Iſrael, Heb. 9.19, 20, 21. <hi>For when</hi> Moſes <hi>had ſpoken every Precept to all the people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law (when he had declared the terms of this Covenant to them) he took the Blood of Calves and Goats, with Water and ſcarlet Wool, and Hyſop, and ſprinkled both the Book, and all the
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:57359:242"/>People, ſaying,</hi> This is the blood of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which God hath ordained to you: <hi>Thus the Blood of Chriſt is called,</hi> the blood of ſprinkling; <hi>Becauſe by his Blood God did ſeal and confirm the Covenant of Grace, as the ſprinkling of the blood of beaſts did confirm the Moſaical Covenant, Hence we are ſaid,</hi> to be juſtified by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>that is, by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Covenant, which was confirmed with his Blood: Chriſt is called</hi> a propitiation through faith in his blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>that is, by a belief of his Goſpel.

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:57359:242"/>believing, that Chriſt is the Son of God, the</hi> Meſſiah, <hi>and Prophet, whom God ſent to reveil his will, includes a general belief of the Goſpel, which he preached; and believing that God raiſed him from the dead doth the ſame, becauſe his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was the laſt and great confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth of the Goſpel. Hence the Apoſtles attribute ſuch things to the Blood of Chriſt, as are the proper imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate office of the Goſpel-Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Blood of Chriſt is the Blood of the Covenant; and therefore all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Goſpel are owing to it, becauſe the Goſpel-Covenant was procured and confirmed by it: Thus</hi> the Gentiles, who were a far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt; <hi>and the Gentiles and Jews</hi> were reconciled unto God in one body by the croſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. <hi>That is, the Gentiles were received into the fellowſhip of God's Church, and the Jews and Gentiles united in one body: Now this union of Jews and Gentiles is owing to the Goſpel, which takes away all marks of diſtinction and ſeparation, and gives them both an equal right to the bleſſing of the New Covenant: This New Covenant belongs to all mankind; there is now no diſtinction of perſons:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jew, nor Greek, Barbarian, Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:57359:244"/>ſtrange way of interpreting Scripture: <hi>We are justified by his blood; that is, by the Goſpel:</hi> We may as well go on to <hi>verſe</hi> 18. and ſay, <hi>juſtification of life is by the righteouſneſs of one;</hi> that is, by the Goſpel: And to <hi>verſe</hi> 19. and ſay, <hi>We are made righteous by the obedience of one;</hi> that is, by the Goſpel: And from thence we may go on at the ſame rate with other Scriptures, as, <hi>He hath waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from our ſins in his own blood,</hi> Revel. 1.5. that is, in his own Goſpel: <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered up himſelf without ſpot to God, ſhall purge your conſciences from dead works,</hi> Heb. 9.14. that is, the Goſpel ſhall do it: <hi>This is my blood of the new Teſtament, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Matth. 26.28. that is, this is my New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of fins: Rather than make ſuch work with Scripture; we were as good let the Blood of our dear Lord ſtand there, as it ought, in its juſtifying Glory: <hi>We are juſtified by Christ's blood; that is, by the Goſpel:</hi> And is Chriſt's Blood the Goſpel? Or where in all the Scripture is the Blood of Chriſt ſo taken? The Scripture rarely, if ever, ſpeaks of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:57359:244"/>being juſtified by the Goſpel, but it ſpeaks much and often of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified by Chriſt's Blood: <hi>It cleanſes us from all ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>It purges the conſcience,</hi> Heb. 9.19. <hi>It was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Eph. 1.7. <hi>It waſhes us from our ſins,</hi> Rev. 1.5. And yet all this contrary to the expreſs words and <hi>genius</hi> of Scripture, muſt be underſtood not of the Blood of Chriſt, but of the Goſpel; and why of the Goſpel? <hi>Becauſe his Blood confirmed the Goſpel:</hi> And is juſtifying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Goſpel all one? <hi>Chriſt's Blood,</hi> according to the Author, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Covenant with all Mankind;</hi> but all men are not juſtified: When the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſts Blood and Death as confirmative of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Goſpel, it ſpeaks ſometimes in general of all men: Thus <hi>he died for all men,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.15. <hi>Hee gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſom for all,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6. with many other places to the ſame purpoſe: But when the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſt's Blood as juſtifying, it ſpeaks not in general of all, but in particular of Believers only; and yet if juſtify- and confirming the Goſpel were all one, it might be as truly ſaid, that Chriſt juſtifies all as that he died for

<pb n="463" facs="tcp:57359:245"/>And this further appears by the place quoted by the Author, <hi>Moſes ſprinkled the blood on the book and on all the people,</hi> Heb. 9.19.

But to go on; <hi>The Scripture,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>uſes theſe phraſes promiſcuouſly, to be juſtified by Faith, by Chriſt, by Grace; nay, by believing that Christ is the Son of God, or riſen from the dead:</hi> To which I anſwer, All theſe concurr to the ſame Juſtification, but not in the ſame manner: Grace, which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impulſive Cauſe of Juſtification, is not Chriſt or his Blood; the Blood of Chriſt, which is the Matter of our Righteouſneſs, is not Faith; Faith, which is the Hand to receive Chriſt and Grace, is not the Goſpel, the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Juſtification, which contains the Evangelical Axioms, ſuch as thoſe, touching Chriſt's being the Son of God or touching his Reſurrection from the
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:57359:246"/>dead, are: Theſe are diſtinct things and not to be confounded. As for that place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. the Apoſtle ſpeaks indeed of reconciling Jews and Gentiles, but that is not all, he ſpeaks too of <hi>reconciling both to God,</hi> ver. 16. and of <hi>making them one new man in himſelf,</hi> ver. 15. which notes a further reconciliation than that among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even a conjunction with God and Chriſt, according to our Saviours Prayer, <hi>That they maybe one in us,</hi> Joh. 17.21. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the Moſaical Law:</hi> I anſwer, He did ſo as to Types and Ceremonials; but the Moral Law, which is immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized by its intrinſecal Sanctity, ſtands to this day, and the Grace, which was under the Old Teſtament, was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, but made more illuſtrious than it was before. <hi>The Gentiles,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>were at a diſtance from God;</hi> But if they had natural Faith, and could by it pleaſe God, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was leſs and more tolerable; though they were but in the outward Court of the Temple, nay, though they were a thouſand miles off from it, they would do well enough in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world.</p>

And doth the Author do ſo? No ſurely, <hi>We are juſtified by his blood; that is, by the Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which was confirmed with his blood:</hi> Thus the Author: Now if juſtifying and confirming the Covenant be one thing, then the Author allows juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Chriſt's blood; But juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirming the Covenant are not one thing: <hi>Christ's blood,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Author, <hi>confirmed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for all;</hi> but it doth not juſtifie all.

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:57359:249"/>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, when</hi> Abraham<hi>'s poſterity was ſo bleſſed for his ſake: But then Christ's Righteouſneſs and Death ſerve not two ſuch different ends, as theſe men fancy; but they both ſerve the ſame end to establiſh the Covenant: God was ſo well pleaſed with what Chriſt did and ſuffered; that for his ſake he entred into a Covenant of Grace with man: As</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Faith was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to his Poſterity, as their act; but for</hi> Abraham<hi>'s ſake, God entred into Covenant with them, and choſe them for his peculiar people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we have the Author acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> that the obedience of Chriſt did contributé ſomething to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God: <hi>The children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were bleſſed for</hi> Abraham<hi>'s obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and why may not we for Christs?</hi> The confequence is undeniable; but there is a vaſt diſproportion between <hi>Abraham</hi>'s obedience and Chriſts. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s was but the obedience of a man, and of an imperct man; but Chriſts was the obedience of God: His Blood is called, <hi>the blood of God;</hi> and for the very ſame reaſon his obedience may be ſtiled the obedience of God: <hi>Abraham</hi>'s had not a jot or tittle of merit in it, he had nothing to glory in
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:57359:250"/>before God: But Chriſt's was ſo rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meritorious as to purchaſe the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of both Worlds: <hi>Abraham</hi>'s was not imputed to his Poſterity; it was little enough, and (without Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to cover its defects) too little for himſelf: But Chriſt's is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, and is long enough, and broad enough to cover a multitude of Believers, and to juſtifie them before God.

The <hi>Antitheſis</hi> in the Text e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the contrary; Act is here ſet in oppoſition againſt Act, Chriſt's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience againſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Diſobedience. Now, for what the Author alledges, I ſay, it is true, <hi>that of Chriſt's being obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> Phil. 2.8. <hi>reaches down to his death,</hi> but it takes in all the Obedience
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:57359:252"/>of his life; and <hi>that of Chriſts doing Gods will,</hi> Hebr. 10.7. <hi>extends to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himſelf,</hi> but it compriſes all the righteouſneſs of his life too. It is true, that the Apoſtle in this 5. Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> doth firſt ſpeak of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings; but his active and paſſive Obedience are ſo near in conjunction, that the Apoſtle may in his diſcourſe eaſily paſs from the one to the other: Nay, as I before noted, when the one is expreſſed in Scripture, the other is implied; ſo that the Apoſtle doth not indeed paſs from one thing to another, but only vary his Phraſe. The Author himſelf confeſſes, <hi>That thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, his righteouſneſs and Obedience, ſeem to take in the whole compaſs of his Obedience, in doing and ſuffering the will of God.</hi> And how doth the active and paſſive righteouſneſs of Chriſt juſtify us, or make us righteous? Why, <hi>theſe procured that Goſpel Covenant, whereby we are declared righteous, and rewarded as righteous.</hi> Now, this Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſtand good, when juſtifying and procuring the Covenant ſhall be, what they can never be, one and the ſame thing: <hi>Chriſts active and paſſive Obedience,</hi> according to the Author, <hi>procured the Covenant for all Men;</hi> But
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:57359:253"/>ſurely they do not juſtify all Men. The whole Obedience of Chriſt may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidered two wayes: either as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curative of the Covenant, and ſo it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us juſtifiable; or as is it received by Faith, and ſo it actually juſtifies us: But neither of theſe can be without a Divine imputation; without that firſt fundamental imputation (which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in ſuch Scripture expreſſions, as tell us, <hi>that Chriſt died for us</hi>) the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Chriſt could not have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred us juſtifiable any more than it doth Devils; and without that ſecond particular imputation (which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in ſuch Scripture expreſſions, as tell us, <hi>That we are juſtified by Christs Blood, that we are made righteous by Christ's Obedience.</hi>) the Obedience of Chriſt could not juſtify us; for it juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us not as it procures the Covenant (that is done, according to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, for all Men; and all Men are not juſtified) but it juſtifies us, as it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly made ours; and made ours it cannot be without an Imputation. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Author, the Apoſtle muſt be interpreted thus: <hi>By the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all unto Juſtification of life; that is, by the righteouſneſs of one the Covenant was
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:57359:253"/>procured:</hi> and ſo, <hi>by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous; that is, by the obedience of one the Covenant was procured.</hi> But this Interpretation is ſo harſh and ſtrange, that, I ſuppoſe, few will be able to receive and own it: But the Author tells us, <hi>That the Apoſtle,</hi> in ver. 17. <hi>acquaints us, who the juſtified are, not thoſe who are righteous by imputed righteouſneſs, but thoſe who by the Goſpel, which is the grace of God, are made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as God is;</hi> But by the grace of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. is not meant the Goſpel, but the rich mercy of God; and by the gift of righteouſneſs there, is not meant inherent graces, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, which is made over to us by a gracious imputation; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame righteouſneſs, which is called <hi>the righteouſneſs of one,</hi> verſ. 18. and <hi>the obedience of one,</hi> verſ 19. The Apoſtle is ſo far from ſpeaking of our own inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſs, that the great ſcope of the Chapter is not of Sanctification, but Juſtification; and that not by a righteouſneſs of our own, but of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that is, of Chriſt. But now, let us hear the Authors concluſion: <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſs and our own, are both ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary to our ſalvation; the first, as the foundation of the Covenant; the other, as
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:57359:254"/>the condition of it.</hi> Very well, Faith in Chriſt is indeed the condition of the Covenant, and in us inherent; but I had thought, the Author had been treating of that righteouſneſs, which is the matter of our juſtification, and not only of the condition of the Covenant: To underſtand what that righteouſneſs is, which is the matter of our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt conſider, what it is which we are to anſwer unto in the point of juſtification; if we are only to anſwer unto the terms of the Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, then indeed Faith anſwers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; but what will be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this? If we are only to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer unto the terms of the Goſpel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, then our Saviour, contrary to his words, came <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>to diſſolve the Law,</hi> to untye all the Bonds of it, to looſen the very Foundation of it; then Juſtification is not in ſuch a way, as <hi>eſtabliſhes the Law,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. But in ſuch a way as voides and abrogates it, then all true Believers muſt be in a ſtate of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the defect of their Graces muſt be no ſins, for they have that true Faith, which anſwers the terms of the Goſpel; and to more then theſe they are not to anſwer; then the Goſpel, the great
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:57359:254"/>Charter of Grace, hath no pardon in it, for no more is required of us, but the truth of Faith and other Graces; and the want of true Faith and other Graces the Goſpel doth not pardon: Then Chriſt dyed not to obtain the pardon of thoſe ſins, which are conſiſtent with Goſpel-ſincerity, but dyed to prevent them from being ſins, which otherwiſe would have been ſins, and to prevent them from being pardoned by his Blood; and to name but one thing more: Then all the <hi>Pagans</hi> muſt be in a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſtate; for the Goſpel Covenant being founded for them alſo, they are only to anſwer to the terms of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and to theſe they have a very eaſie full anſwer, that they knew them not: By theſe things it appears, that in the point of Juſtification, we muſt anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer not to the terms of the Goſpel on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to the pure perfect Law alſo; and to that, nothing of our own imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Graces can reſpond; nothing leſs can anſwer, but the perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Obedience of Chriſt, which is made ours by imputation: Hence the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one we have justification of life; and by the obedience of one, we are made or conſtituted righteous.</hi>

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:57359:255"/>truth of this charge; becauſe according to this principle, we can do nothing but ſin, before we be united to Christ; hence theſe Men conſtantly place our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before our Sanctification, that we are first accounted holy by God before we are made ſo; now our Justification follows our union to Chriſt, and our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion follows our Juſtification; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt firſt be united to Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ſanctified, that is, before we are made holy: Hence we are told,</hi> that holyneſs is a remote end of vocation, but the next end is to come to Chriſt. <hi>And the ſame Author makes a ſpeech for Chriſt to a Sinner (more gracious than all the Goſpel invitations)</hi> though thou haſt reſiſted my Spirit, refuſed my grace, wearied me with thy iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet come to me, this will make me amends, I require nothing of thee elſe but to come.</p>

<pb n="985" facs="tcp:57359:256"/>it may ſeem harſh to ſome, that before Faith in Chriſt, there ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good in us, that our beſt actions ſhould be ſins: but if we look on a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Man, that is, a Man without Faith in the Scripture-glaſs, nothing can be plainer; take him at an honeſt calling, <hi>The plowing of the wicked is ſin,</hi> Prov. 21.4.

                     <hi>the whole progreſs of the Soul to a cloſure with Chriſt; the ſeveral ſteps to this are</hi> Conviction, Compunction, Humiliation, and Faith, which is the uniting Grace. <hi>Now if there be nothing of forjaking of ſin inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in all this, then Men muſt be united to Christ before they forſake their ſins:</hi> Now, Conviction is a great ſenſe of the evil of ſin, and the evil after it, of its abominable &amp; accurſed Nature, and the Judgments which follow it; and this is as it ought to be, Men muſt be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to ſee theſe evils, before they will reform their lives; <hi>Reform? nay, you are out, this is not the end of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to reform ſin (that is a legal way) but</hi> Compunction <hi>is the end of it; well
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:57359:257"/>then, what is this</hi> Compunction? <hi>Why,</hi> Compunction is firſt a great fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damned, he ſees death, wrath, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity near to him; next to this ſucceeds a great ſorrow and mourning for ſin, and that which perfects this Compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is a ſeparation from ſin; <hi>this is ſomething like, but by a ſeparation from ſin, you muſt not underſtand a leaving ſin, but ſuch a ſeparation as conſiſts with living in it;</hi> For it is nothing but a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing, or rather not unwilling, that the Lord ſhould take it away; the Lord doth not wound the heart, that the Soul ſhould firſt heal it ſelf, but that it may deſire the Phyſician, the Lord Jeſus, to come and heal it: <hi>So that all he means by ſeparation from ſin, is to be content that Chriſt by an irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power ſhould take away our ſins:</hi> By this Separation the Soul is cut off from the will to ſin, not from all <hi>(no, nor from any)</hi> ſin in the will, for that muſt be mortified by a Spirit of holyneſs, after the Soul is implanted into Chriſt. <hi>Now this is down right non-ſenſe, for he muſt be a ſubtil Man, who can diſtinguiſh between a will to ſin, and ſin in the will; and all that can be made of it is this, that this ſeparation is a willingneſs, or rather not unwillingneſs, that Chriſt
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:57359:258"/>ſhould take away our ſins againſt our wills; and therefore he tells us,</hi> That this Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is no part of our Sanctification: The whole deſign of this Compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to work humiliation in us, which is the work of the Spirit, whereby the Soul, broken off from ſelf-conceit and confidence, ſubmitteth and lieth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, to be diſpoſed as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; this ſelf-confidence is any hope of pleaſing God, by Reformation, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or any thing he can do. When Men feel this Compunction, the great danger is, leſt they ſhould ſeck eaſe, by Repentance and Reformation; if they can repent and reform, they have ſome hopes <hi>(as well they may if they do ſo)</hi> that this will heal their wounds, and pacify the Lord towards them, when they ſee no peace in a ſinful courſe, they will try a good one: But this is a dangerous miſtake; for while it is thus with the Soul, he is uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Chriſt: For he that truſts to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to ſave him, or makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his own Saviour, or reſts in his duties without a Saviour <hi>(that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Author, all thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and reform)</hi> he can never have Chriſt to ſave him: So that true Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is this; when the Soul feels its
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:57359:258"/>own inability and unworthineſs, that it may lye under God to be diſpoſed of; that is, contented to be ſaved or damned, as ſhall pleaſe God; and when the Soul is at this paſs, it is <hi>vas capax,</hi> a veſſel capable of Grace: And now they are made thus hollow and empty by Humiliation, they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving Chriſt, as an hollow veſſel is of receiving any thing. <hi>This is a new notion of our union to Chriſt, that it is a receiving Chriſt into us, as an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low veſſel receives any liquor poured into it: This is a Philoſophical account of the nature of Humiliation, that a man muſt have ſuch a ſenſe of his inability to pleaſe God, that he ſhall never dare to be ſo prophane as to attempt it, but muſt leave repentance and reformation to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal chriſtleſs men; and that he may be ſo ſenſible of his unworthineſs, that he ſhall contentedly ſubmit to God to be damned or ſaved, as he pleaſes: And now the Soul being thus hollow, is fit to receive Chriſt; and being grown careleſs of its Salvation, and indifferent whether it be ſaved or damned, (for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thus to ſubmit without being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in ſome meaſure which God ſhall chuſe) it is a fit object for mercy; certainly it is a very hard thing to bring
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:57359:259"/>any man in his wits to this; and I find by this Author, that God is very hard put to it to humhle the Soul thus: For he is forced</hi> to irritate and ſtir up origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal corruption, to ſtir the dunghil <hi>(a very unfit office for an Holy Being) that ſo men finding themſelves ſenſibly, grow worſe and worſe, may deſpair of growing better, and leave off ſuch vain attempts, and ſit down humble under God:</hi> Nay, the Lord loads, and tires, and wearies the Soul, by its own endeavours, till it can ſtir no more; <hi>That is, when the Soul labours to repent and reform; the Spirit of God, which ſhould aſſiſt ſuch pious endeavours withdraws it ſelf;</hi> becauſe it knows the Soul would reſt therein without Chriſt: <hi>Now I know not, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers most by this: The ſinner who is thus humbled, or God who thus humbles him; for it muſt needs be as contrary to the holy merciful nature of God, to uſe ſuch methods of Humiliation, as it is to the proud heart of man, to be thus humbled: Thus you ſee that Humiliation hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with repentance, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our lives.</hi>

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:57359:260"/>as if we could mortifie the deeds of the body, without that holy Spirit, which is given to Believers for that end: This were to render Chriſt, Faith, the holy Spirit unneceſſary to our Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to render our ſelves like thoſe Pagans (of whom St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks) who would not be made Chriſtians, <hi>Quia quaſi ſibi ſufficiunt de bonâ vitâ ſuâ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Enarr. in Pſal. <hi>31.</hi>

<pb n="495" facs="tcp:57359:261"/>is without Faith in Chriſt, is, as our Church ſaith of works without Faith, <hi>But dead before God: Nemo computet bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na opera ſua ante fidem,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> If we would reform indeed, we muſt go to Chriſt by Faith: <hi>But,</hi> ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>in this Humiliation of Mr.</hi> Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hards, <hi>a man must have ſuch a ſenſe of his inability to pleaſe God, that he muſt not dare be ſo prophane as to attempt it; and ſuch a ſenſe of his unworthineſs, as to ſubmit to God, whether he will ſave or damn him, he muſt in ſome meaſure be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, whether he be ſaved or damned; but it is an hard thing to bring a man in his wits to this.</hi> To which, I anſwer, for the firſt, a ſenſe of our inability to pleaſe God, is a thing ſo neceſſary, that our Saviour tells <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that ſhe was <hi>wretched,</hi> and <hi>miſerable,</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> and muſt have <hi>her gold,</hi> and <hi>raiment,</hi> and <hi>eye-ſalve,</hi> and all <hi>from him:</hi> If we think we can pleaſe God in our ſelves, &amp; not in the beloved Jeſus Chriſt; or that we can pleaſe God, by walking in our own ſtrength, and not in the power of Grace, we do but deceive our ſelves, and our labour will be but in vain; it will fare with us, as it did with the man ſtoried of in one of the Jewiſh Rabbins, <hi>who in the

To which, I anſwer; Our Union to Chriſt is not indeed perfect before Obedience, as to its Fruit and Conſequences: but it is as to its eſſentials; for the Believer in the very inſtant of believing hath a true title to the promiſes of pardon, of the Spirit and of eternal Life: So that ſhould he immediately, and before any one act of Obedience depart this Life, he ſhould undoubtedly, and without any ſcruple enter that bleſſed Region, where are the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect; as for that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8. where our Saviour tells them, That <hi>bearing of fruit they ſhould be his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> it is parallel to that place, <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples,</hi> Joh. 8.31.

<pb n="505" facs="tcp:57359:266"/>in the word extends it ſelf; or elſe their diſcipleſhip muſt have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to the other World: And in that <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8. they were Diſciples before their bearing of fruit, for they could not bear fruit without being branches in Chriſt; and Branches they could not be without being Diſciples: when there fore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>ſo ſhall ye be my Diſciples,</hi> the meaning only is, that by their fruitfulneſs they ſhould give a real proof and demonſtration, that they are indeed true Diſciples and Branches of Chriſt. But, ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>This Doctrine deſtroys the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to holyneſs, and thruſts holyneſs out of the Chriſtian Religion; our union to Christ is perfected while we are unholy, and when we are united to Christ, there is leſs need of holyneſs than before, for now the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us.</hi> To which I anſwer, As to that, <hi>that our union to Chriſt is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted while we are unholy:</hi> If by <hi>unholy,</hi> be meant only before a holy life, Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before that are ſo perfectly united to Chriſt, as to have a true title to the promiſes of Pardon, the Spirit, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: If by <hi>unholy,</hi> is meant a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, no wicked Man is united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt; this would be a diſhonour
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:57359:267"/>to our Saviour, a contradiction to the Goſpel; ſuch a one walks in darkneſs, and cannot have fellowſhip with God, who is Light, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks: But a Believer (who before an holy life is united to Chriſt) is not, muſt not be called a wicked Man. As to the other, <hi>That when we are united to Chriſt, there is no need of holyneſs, becauſe of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us.</hi> I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, That before I have proved, that this aſſertion, that imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes holyneſs needleſs, is but a Popiſh calumny, and without any ground at all.</p>

                     <hi>there is no certain way to get into Chriſt; the method preſcribed is,</hi> Conviction, Compunction, Humiliation, and Faith, which is the uniting Grace. <hi>Now I obſerve first, that a Man is paſſive in all this, and can contribute nothing to it himſelf, any otherwiſe than as he is acted by an irreſiſtible power; and it is a vain thing to give ſuch rules and directions, as no man can follow; this only tells us, by what methods God unites us to Chriſt,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:57359:267"/>not what we muſt do, but what we must ſuffer in order to this union; A Sinner may ſtir up in himſelf ſome natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſin, ſome natural fear, ſorrow, &amp;c. And in a ſenſe of this, may ſet upon the work of Reformation, of leaving his ſins and performing duties: But all this they tell us, is to no purpoſe, for unleſs this</hi> Conviction, Compunction, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, <hi>be wrought in us by the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible power of the Spirit of God, (which no Man can poſſibly tell whether it be or not) it is not of the right ſtamp, and will avail us nothing; ſo that the Sinner hath nothing to do but to ſit ſtill, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expect, till God will do all for him.</hi>

Chriſt did not in vain call Men <hi>to come to him;</hi> and yet withal tells them, <hi>That no Man could come to him, except the Father drew him,</hi> Joh. 6.44. <hi>Moſes</hi> was but to lift up the Rod, but it was God only who could divide the Sea; we are to uſe the means, but it is God only who can work the great work of Grace: Theſe Rules, though we cannot follow them of our ſelves, may yet ſhew us our duty; and if we reflect upon our ſelves, they may
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:57359:268"/>point out our impotency to us, and withal they miniſter under that Spirit, which in the uſe of means infuſes the life of Grace into Men. <hi>Polychronius</hi> in the 6.

St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>Timothy instruct the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,</hi> not as if they had a power of themſelves to repent, <hi>but if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure would give them repentance,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.25. All Rules and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do but miniſter under the Holy Spirit, who gives Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as it pleaſeth. But ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>Theſe tell us not, what we muſt do, but what we must ſuffer in order to our union to Chriſt.</hi> To which I anſwer, we are to uſe the means, and thus far we muſt be doers, but, I ſuppoſe, we muſt ſuffer the Holy Spirit to have the glory of our Regeneration, we muſt not preſume to be ſuch doers, as if we could work Regeneration our ſelves,

<pb n="511" facs="tcp:57359:269"/>contributes nothing to our union to Chriſt, but brings us to ſuch a temper of mind, as to be content to have Chriſt, or go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him as God ſhall pleaſe; this is all Men get by</hi> Humiliation, <hi>that if the Lord intend to do them good, this is the way in which he will do it; but though they be humbled, they cannot be ſure whether God intend to do them good or not; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are told,</hi> we are as much bound to ſubmit to God, whether he will ſave or damn us, as we are to ſubmit to the diſpoſal of God, as to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mercy; though you muſt pray for mercy, it muſt be with ſubmiſſion to Gods good will; ſaying, the Lords will is good, whether it be to ſave or damn; but mine is evil, though it be to be ſaved, and have Jeſus Chriſt: Nay, we are much more bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to God, whether he will ſave or damn us, than we are to ſubmit in the leſſer concernments of this life; if it be pride to murmur, in caſe the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you ſmaller matters, the off-alls of this life; is it not greater pride to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with him, if he deny the greater, the things of another life?

                     <hi>it is freely gratuitouſly given,</hi> Phil. 1.29. Seing then it is thus, ſhould we not ſubmit to God for every crumb of bread, drop of drink, and moments patience, becauſe they are his gifts; and muſt we not ſubmit to him for Faith, becauſe it is ſuch? Had not God given a Jeſus, a Saviour, to Men, they could not have made a juſt complaint againſt him; and now there being one, that he is not known all the World over, the <hi>Pagans</hi> may not open their lips againſt God; and in the Church where Chriſt is known, that all Men have no Faith, no Man may queſtion God about it: Gifts are free and muſt be ſubmitted for. The Apoſtle aſſerts Gods Soveraignty clearly: <hi>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. 9.18. And if any dare repy or find fault, the Apoſtle takes him up: <hi>Nay, but O Man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God?</hi> If thou hadſt but any ſentiments of thy own nothingneſs, or rayes of the Divine Majeſty, thou wouldeſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dare to queſtion, or to implead thy Maker; before whom thou art but a Worm, a piece of Clay to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of at his pleaſures: It is certain that God owes us nothing.

It was horrible inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and preſumption in him, who prayed: <hi>Redde mihi vitam aeternam, quam debes;</hi> And it would be no leſs for any one to pray: <hi>Redde mihi fidem vivam quam debes: Verbum (debet) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenum habet,</hi> as <hi>Peter Lumbard</hi> hath it.

<pb n="516" facs="tcp:57359:272"/>in thoſe to whom it is given: This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is clearly founded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all in the Church are called, but all are not <hi>drawn of the Father,</hi> all do not <hi>hear and learn of the Father,</hi> Joh. 6.44, 45. For theſe taught and drawn ones do all of them come to Chriſt, which all Men in the Church do not; all in the Church are called, but all are not <hi>called according to purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28. for then all would love God, as thoſe called ones do, and by conſequence all would have that Faith, which works by love. <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified, to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs, but to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt the power of God and wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23, 24. All of them had an external general call; thoſe to whom Chriſt was a ſtumbling block and fooliſhneſs, had ſuch a call; for an unknown, an unreveiled Chriſt could not be a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block or fooliſhneſs: But beſides this call there is another, an internal effectual call, ſuch as makes Chriſt the power and wiſdom of God to Men, ſuch as works Faith and other Graces in Men: Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, That they are the called, called with a more internal and efficacious call than other
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:57359:272"/>Men are. Theſe things laid down, all things in Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi> are very eaſie; all Men in the Church have an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal call, and ſo a ſufficient warrant to believe in Chriſt, it will be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption at all in them to do ſo. The Object, Jeſus Chriſt is evidently ſet forth before their eyes, but that they may believe in him indeed, they muſt wait for a particular internal call, for that Grace which works Faith in the heart; if not, the work of Faith muſt be their own; they muſt believe of themſelves: And this I fear, though the Object, Chriſt be free for them would be preſumption, becauſe the Scripture aſſures us, that <hi>Faith is the gift of God.</hi> All Men in the Church ſhould come to Chriſt, for the Evangelical command makes it their duty; yet, if we believe our Saviour, there muſt be internal teachings and tractions from the Father, to make us truly come to him: All in the Church are by the Goſpel called to be Believers, &amp; ſo to the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="518" facs="tcp:57359:273"/>were; I mean, which calleth Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to being where it was not before. But then ſaith Mr. <hi>Sherlock: The Sinner muſt only wait till he is called, and ſo his work is at an end for this time.</hi> To which I anſwer, His work is not at an end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſtill to wait; if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which makes Faith the free-gift of God, be true, there is no nearer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to Heaven, then by waiting upon God for Faith in the uſe of means.

May we pry into the eternal Rolls, and make them the meaſures of our acting? No ſurely, the Rule is before us in the Goſpel, which we muſt not wave, becauſe there are ſecret Decrees: A man, that would argue againſt himſelf; and his venturing upon Chriſt from theſe principles, muſt do it thus: If I am eternally reprobated, then it is to no purpoſe to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt: but I am eternally repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is to no purpoſe to venture: But how doth he know the <hi>Minor,</hi> or what reaſon hath he for it?

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:57359:276"/>Salvation? Is there any ſuch repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation in Scripture, as barrs out of Heaven, ſuch as by Faith venture upon Chriſt? No ſurely, Chriſt hath ſo far dyed for all men, as to found for them that general promiſe: <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> This is a plain ſure foundation for men to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon, none that by Faith venture upon Chriſt ſhall be barred out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by any Decree of God, becauſe his Decree cannot claſh with his Promiſe: It is very irregular arguing to ſay, I know not Gods Decree, therefore I'll neglect my duty. St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Philippians to work out their Salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God, which worketh in you to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. Might the <hi>Philippians</hi> have ſaid, how do we know what Gods pleaſure is, or what he will work in us? Why ſhould we work at ſuch a venture, or at the pleaſure of another? No, the fear and trembling in the Text was enough to keep them back from arguing at that rate: Suppoſe now, that there were no ſuch thing as Election, will there not be a paucity, and an hard venture ſtill? Our Saviour tells us, that <hi>few find the way to life,</hi> Matth. 7.14. And God,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:57359:276"/>whoſe preſcience is immutable, eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſaw that it would be ſo; and what muſt we do now?

To ſatisfie this we are directed to marks: Thus this infallible testimony of the Spirit muſt in its laſtireſolve, be founded upon moral evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> So the Author: To which, I anſwer, When the Spirit witneſſeth with our ſpirit; when Gods Spirit and Mans concurr, and ſo heaven and earth agree in it; one would think it might paſs without further examination: The Teſtimony of the Spirit is ſuch, that he, to whom it made, certainly knows, that it is the Spirit of Truth it ſelf which bears the Teſtimony, otherwiſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it ſelf teſtifies, and would not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by him, to whom the Teſtimony is made; that is, he teſtifies, and doth not teſtifie, if he do not make a man ſure, who it is that teſtifies. The Teſtimony is to make us ſure, that we are the children of God; it is to make us with confidence cry out <hi>Abba,</hi> Father: It is to be an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſeal of our Salvation; and how can this be, if we know not who teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.

<pb n="536" facs="tcp:57359:282"/>ſin, is overpowered by indwelling ſin; he finds natural fears and terrors, when he is tempted to ſin, which gives ſome check to him, and makes him ſin againſt his own will with ſome unwillingneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy; he approves the Law of God as juſt and equal, his conſcience aſſents to it, but there is a ſtrong byaſs upon his will, which runs counter to all thoſe holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and makes him a Slave and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his luſts. Now, not to diſpute which of theſe two the Apoſtle means in</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>I think it is hard to aſſign any difference between them; the regenerate Man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this deſcription, is full as bad as the ungenerate; or if there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the regenerate Man is the worſt of the two, becauſe in the regenerate Man the ſpirit is led into captivity; but in the ungenerate only natural conſcience, which is a much weaker principle, and ſo is capable of a better excuſe, is led into captivity: But which of theſe two it is, no Man can tell, and therefore a regenerate Man hath great reaſon to fear, that he may be unregenerate; and an ungenerate Man hath as much reaſon to hope, that he may be regenerate; and what becomes then of this evidence of Sanctification to prove our union to Chriſt, when Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication it ſelf cannot be diſtinguiſhed from an unſanctified ſtate.</hi>

                     <hi>we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh a ſanctified and an unſanctified man, an unregenerate man is under the reign of ſin, and a regenerate man (as they deſcribe him) is ſo too.</hi> Why ſo? He may be <hi>Carnal,</hi> Rom. 7.14. but not as the ungenerate, totally altogether Carnal, without any ſpark of Spiritual life in him; but partially only, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Reliques of corruption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in him: He is Spiritual, ſo far as he is regenerate; yet Carnal, becauſe he hath ſome corrupt fleſh in him. This appears, becauſe though regenerate, he is ſtill to go on mortifying the fleſh, and <hi>the fleſh is yet lusting in him against the Spirit:</hi> The Babes in Chriſt are called Carnal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. yet they were not unregenerate, but their regenerate Man is <hi>ſold under ſin,</hi> Rom. 7.14. He is ſo; but what, as Ahab, <hi>who ſold himſelf to work evil?</hi> What, as the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are, who are willing Captives, ready to obey the deſires of the fleſh? no; but he is a captive againſt his will, he cannot wholly rid himſelf of thoſe luſts, which lye as ſo many heavy chains upon him; ſo far as regenerate, he is a free-man, but becauſe Regeneration is imperfect, he is yet a Captive: But <hi>their regenerate man may do thoſe things
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:57359:283"/>he allows not, nay, thoſe things he hates,</hi> Rom. 7.15. Not that, as the profane, he does outward groſs acts of ſin, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in them; but that the <hi>inevitabile malum,</hi> that <hi>unavoidable concupiſcence,</hi> (though he diſallow &amp; hate it &amp; all its progeny) will be ſtirring in his thoughts and deſires; nay, and ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing too. That the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch unavoidable defects, is clear from the following words: <hi>It is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me,</hi> verſ. 17. which words can be only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of unavoidable defects: But <hi>their unregenerate Man neglects duty, the good he would do he does not,</hi> verſ. 19. not that he doth not do duties to God, but that the clog of corruption impedes him from doing them, in that pure and uninterrupted manner as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: He finds <hi>a Law in his Members warring against the Law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the Law of ſin, which is in his Members,</hi> verſ. 23. He hath a Divine Spiritual life in him, but becauſe Regeneration is imperfect, the indwelling ſin is ſtill in him, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, though not reigning; by theſe things it appears, that there is a vaſt difference between a regenerate Man and an ungenerate: But if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

                     <hi>in his Diſcourſe of the Law of ſin, attempts to aſſign the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Law of ſin in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:57359:284"/>and it in the unregenerate; and hath given ſuch a Deſcription of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate, that there is ſcarce ſuch an unregenerate Man in the World; and yet if we muſt judge what a regenerate Man is, by inverting the Character of the unregenerate, he is by odds much the worſe Man: As firſt,</hi> When the whole bent and tendency of the heart is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſin, when the propenſities of the Soul thereto are entire and unmixt, there it is the Law of ſin in the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate: <hi>But is every one a regenerate Man, who hath ſome good propenſities in him? who hath ſome wouldings and vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leities to that which is good? then there are few unregenerate in the World. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, which is the explication of the former,</hi> when all the ſeveral Faculties of the Soul are altogether on ſins ſide, and wholly take its part, then it is the Law of ſin in the unregenerate; where the underſtanding gives in its final po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive dictate, that ſin is good, repreſents it as eligible to the will, the will upon this cloſes with it, embraces it it, cleaves to it, the affections, deſire, joy, delight, run out upon it; where it is thus, the caſe is determined, yea, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy: <hi>But where ſhall we find ſuch a Man? I believe there was never ſuch a
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:57359:284"/>Man born; too many chuſe evil though they know it to be evil, for the ſeeming advantages of profit or pleaſure; but to chuſe evil, as believing it to be good, and to rejoyce and delight in it, as good and eligible for it ſelf, is ſuch an unregenerate ſtate as the Devil never arrived at; for though he be a wicked Spirit, yet he is no Fool, as thoſe muſt be, who miſtake evil for good in ſuch plain inſtances: The Heathens themſelves at this rate were all regenerate, for their conſciences accuſed them for doing evil,</hi> Rom. 2. <hi>They knew good to be good, and evil evil: There was never ſuch a Man as he deſcribes, when he tells us,</hi> That ſin comes to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſays: Art thou willing that I ſhould rule? Yes, ſaith he, with all my heart, I like thy commands, I am thine, I ſubmit to be at thy diſpoſe, I here ſwear fealty and allegiance to thee, &amp;c. <hi>This Oath, &amp;c. might very well have been ſpared, for there is enough without it; and yet if this be the difference, that the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Man chuſes ſin, believing it to be good, and the regenerate Man chuſes ſin, though he knows it to be evil, it is plain that the regenerate is much the worſe, becauſe his ſins have the greatest aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that any ſins are capable of, which the ſins of an unregenerate Man have not:</hi>
                     <pb n="542" facs="tcp:57359:285"/>viz. <hi>That they are ſins againſt knowledge; and ſo, according to our Saviours rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, this regenerate Man will be beaten with more ſtripes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Jacomb</hi> aſſigns the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law of ſin in the regenerate and in the unregenerate:<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Firſt, <hi>When the whole bent of the heart is towards ſin, when the propenſities are entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, there it is the Law of ſin in the unregenerate.</hi> But, ſaith the Author, <hi>is every one regenerate who hath ſome good propenſities? Who hath ſome wouldings &amp; velleities, to that which is good? Then there are few unregenerate Men in the World.</hi> To which I anſwer, The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate may indeed have ſome wouldings and velleities to good, not of himſelf; for <hi>in his fleſh</hi> (and ſuch he is all over by Nature) <hi>there is no good,</hi> but from the common motions and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Holy Spirit: Yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe, the bent of his heart is to ſin, the power of ſin is habitual in him, which is all the intent and very expreſſion of the Doctor in that place. Secondly, <hi>When all the faculties of the Soul are on ſins ſide, when the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding gives in its final poſitive dictate, that ſin is good, repreſents it as eligible to the will, the will cloſes with it, the
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:57359:285"/>affections run out upon it; there the caſe,</hi> ſaith the Doctor, <hi>is determined.</hi> But, ſaith the Author: <hi>Never ſuch a Man was born, as to chuſe evil believing it to be good, to delight and rejoyce in it, as good and eligible for it ſelf.</hi> To which I anſwer, The Authors diſcourſe runs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, as if the Doctor had aſſerted, that the underſtanding in the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate did repreſent ſin as good; that is, as conformable to the Law and Will of God, and ſo good. Hence the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells us: <hi>That the Devil, though a wicked Spirit, is no Fool; that the very Heathen know good to be good, and evil evil:</hi> But all this is beſides the ſcope; the Doctor never ſaid or meant ſo, when he ſaith, that <hi>the underſtanding dictates ſin to be good:</hi> No Man, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, will interpret the words thus; the underſtanding dictates ſin to be conformable to the Will of God, that is, ſin to be no ſin: No, the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knows ſin to be ſin, ſin to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Will of God; yet it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſin as good in other reſpects, and ſo good as to caſt the ballance in the heart on ſins ſide; it may be there are baits of profit or pleaſure in it: Nay, it is my own thought, that the pravity in ſinſul actions comes <hi>ſub ratione con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venientiae,</hi>
                     <pb n="544" facs="tcp:57359:286"/>and offers it ſelf as congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo good to the corrupt Will and heart of Man, the very difformity or contradiction to the will of God, as intrinſecally black as it is, bluſhes and looks fair to that Carnal mind which is enmity againſt God: An unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man <hi>drinks in iniquity as water,</hi> Job 15.16. being filthy himſelf, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, though a very foul thing, goes down naturally with him, and is as it were his proper Element. St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his Confeſſions, ſpeaking of his ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Apples, ſaith that he was: <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis malus;</hi>

                     <hi>Amavi defectum meum, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpta projeci, epulatus inde ſolaminiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, quâ laetabar fruens; ſi quid illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum intravit in os meum, condimentum facinus erat.</hi> He confeſſes, the very ſin it ſelf was grateful to him: If Sinners did not believe ſin to be good in ſome reſpect or other; if they did look on it as evil, and nothing but pure impure evil, it were utterly impoſſible that they ſhould chuſe it or delight in it; the will cannot <hi>appetere malum ſub ratione mali,</hi> for that were <hi>appetere non appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,</hi> which is impoſſible. I conclude with the words of the Doctor, in that place: <hi>Whoſoever upon deliberation judges a ſinful courſe to be the best, and
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:57359:286"/>thereupon chuſes, embraces, falls in with it, delights in it, continues in it, in this Man 'tis the Law of ſin;</hi> this Man is, as I take it, a Servant of ſin, and willing it ſhould rule: <hi>There is,</hi> as learned Biſhop <hi>Reynolds</hi> ſaith, <hi>a Covenant, a virtual bargain between him and his luſts, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to ſerve and obey them.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But Thirdly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</note> The Law of ſin hath dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent workings in the People of God than in others; <hi>This working of the Law of ſin in Gods People, me thinks, is an ill thing. But let us hear how it is:</hi> Firſt, Where ſin is committed induſtriouſly and deſignedly, there it is the Law of ſin in the Graceleſs; <hi>unleſs Men be very cunning at the trade of ſin, they are not under the Law of it, as graceleſs perſons are: Grace is conſistent with taking all fair opportunities of ſinning, ſo we do not deſign it before hand.</hi> Secondly, When the temptation eaſily prevails, then it is the Law of ſin in the unregenerate; <hi>This is an Argument indeed, that a Man is a willing Slave; but when a Man is conquered by a temptation, though he make ſome reſistance, it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſin is his Master, which rules and governs, eſpecially if this be often, ſuch a Man ſurely is none of Chriſts free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and therefore not to fail.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:57359:287"/>When ſin carries it in ſpite of all oppoſition, againſt all external diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, threatnings of the Law, the Scepter of the Goſpel, the Love of God, and his Wrath, the Death and Wounds of Chriſt, Reproofs, Reſolutions, Vowes, Promiſes, &amp;c. then it is the Law of ſin; <hi>So that it ſeems, when ſin carries it in deſpite of all external oppoſitions only, it is the mark of an unregenerate Man; but when it carries it againſt internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal oppoſitions, that is a ſign of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Man; for a regenerate Man has the ſame external oppoſitions, to preſerve him from ſin, that an unregenerate Man hath, and beſides theſe he hath internal oppoſitions, the checks of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which he ſays the unregenerate Man has not. And</hi> Fourthly, When it is ſinning and no ſenſe of ſin, no after Repentance for it, then it is the Law of ſin: <hi>Now what bad Man is there, who does not at one time or other repent of his ſins, &amp; complain of them? And how many are there, that repent of their ſins, and make large Confeſſions of them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them again? There are no Men, but do at one time or other expreſs ſome ſorrow for their ſins, (which he calls Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) and there are a great many, who pretend thus to be ſorry for their ſins,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:57359:287"/>who it is to be feared, are never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Men for it; and yet were there any ſuch, who ſin without any ſenſe of it, they would be much better then thoſe regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men, who feel the gripes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for ſin, and yet return to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This working of the Law of ſin in Gods People is an ill thing.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Oh! that we had perfection! But while we are here ſin will be in us, and whileſt it is in us, it will work in ſome meaſure: <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcere nolo &amp; concupiſco,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Temp. Serm. <hi>45.</hi>
                     </note> The firſt mark in the Doctor, is <hi>ſinning induſtriouſly and deſignedly,</hi> and this is a ſure one, and found in all the unregenerate; although all of them are not alike cunning, and Artiſts at the Trade of ſin, all more or leſs make proviſion for the Fleſh, the frame of their Heart, &amp; ſtream of their Thoughts run this way. The Fleſh (as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſpeaks) hath the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting and forecaſting ability at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in them, thus it is not with the regenerate. The Second is, <hi>The temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation eaſily prevails in the unregenerate;</hi> and what more certain? The old heart is as dry tinder, ready to take fire upon every little ſpark; thus it is not with the regenerate, who hath a higher and a better Spirit than his
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:57359:288"/>own, to guard him againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: If he be overcome in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Act of ſin, ſin is not yet his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, becauſe it cannot gain the bent of his heart, and the courſe of his life. The third is, <hi>When ſin carries it againſt all external Diſcouragements, against the threatnings of the Law, the Scepter of the Goſpel, the Love and Wrath of God, the Wounds of Chriſt, Reproofs, Reſolutions, Vowes, &amp;c. then it is the Law of ſin.</hi> Upon which the Author inferrs thus: <hi>It ſeems when ſin carries it againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal oppoſitions only, it is a mark of an unregenerate Man; but when it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it against internal and external op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that is a ſign of a regenerate Man.</hi> To which I anſwer. It is true, when ſin carries it in a regenerate Man, it carries it againſt ſuch internal helps, and principles of Grace as are not in the unregenerate, but then it carries it only in a ſingle Act: But in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate it carries it in a courſe of life too, againſt Law, Goſpel, Wrath, Love, the Blood of Chriſt, the ſmitings of Conſcience, Reproofs, Promiſes, Judgments, ſtill he will ſin on, whileſt he is unregenerate; thus the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate doth not. The Fourth is: <hi>When 'tis ſinning, and no ſenſe of ſin, no after
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:57359:288"/>Repentance for it, then it is the Law of ſin.</hi> But, ſaith the Author: <hi>What bad Man is there, who does not at one time or other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his ſins? and yet were there any ſuch, they would be better than thoſe regenerate Men, who feel the gripes of conſcience for ſin, and yet return to it.</hi> Unto which I anſwer, Surely all bad Men do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their ſins, ſuch as God gives up to a reprobate mind, to a fat heart, to a ſpirit of ſlumber, to a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a brawny hardneſs, which feels nothing, do not do ſo; and yet, I ſuppoſe, theſe are the worſt of Men: Sinning againſt gripes of Conſcience is a great aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but an hard ſenſeleſs heart is the worſt ſtate imaginable on Earth. But ſuppoſe bad Men have ſome kind of Repentance; is it ſuch as the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate have after their falls? No ſurely, the regenerate, as the Doctor hath it, <hi>are greatly humbled, they recover again by true Repentance, they riſe after their falls,</hi> thus unregenerate Men do not.</p>

I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and take a naked promiſe. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Doeſt thou deſire to believe and to have Chriſt, and ſay thus, If it were poſſible for Chriſt and Heaven to be

Anſ.</hi> But is it the grief of thy heart, that thou canſt not deny thy ſelf? Deſireſt thou to cloſe with Chriſt upon any terms? <hi>Obj.</hi> Alas!

But art thou willing, that Chriſt ſhould make thee willing, <hi>(againſt thy will)</hi> and pitch thee upon a promiſe and hold thee there? <hi>(for ſhame, poor Soul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not this)</hi> then comfort thy ſelf, thou haſt a right to Gods promiſes. <hi>Thus this evidence of Sanctification is dwindled away into a deſire to be willing;
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:57359:290"/>Nay, into a deſire to be made willing; and he is a ſtrange Man, who cannot go ſo far.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When a Miniſter comes to comfort poor afflicted ſouls,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> he doth not offer them the Altitudes, the higheſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Holineſs to meaſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by, that would be horrid cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; but he ſets before them that immenſe mercy, which ſtoops down, in its acceptance, to the leaſt ſeeds or ſparks of Grace, to grace latent in a deſire or willing mind; Nay, to that poverty of the ſpirit, which, though it ſeem to it ſelf to have nothing at all of Grace, hath yet a bleſſedneſs entailed on it; a broken heart, which hath ſome truth of Grace, may complain of the prevalency of ſin in ſome ſence.

The Teſtimony is not without in Miracles or Tongues, but within in the heart: <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſs with our ſpirit;</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith not, it beareth witneſs with the Spirit of the Church; for there is one body, and one ſpirit; the Spirit of the Church Catholick is the holy Spirit, which quickens the whole Myſtical Body of Chriſt: And theſe words, <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſs with our ſpirit;</hi> cannot be tranſlated thus: The Spirit beareth witneſs with it ſelf; but the plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is: <hi>It beareth witneſs with our ſpirit;</hi> that is, with the ſpirits and conſciences of particular Believers: And what doth it teſtifie? The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That we are the children of God;</hi> We particular Believers are ſo. Thus in another place, <hi>ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of Promiſe,</hi> Eph. 1.13.

<pb n="570" facs="tcp:57359:299"/>ſealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.22. He hath dealt ſo with us in particular. The Teſtimony of the Spirit in the Goſpel is, that all Believers are the Sons of God: But the Teſtimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our ſpirits is, that we are Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſo the Sons of God in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. This Teſtimony of the Spirit, (though ſo fully aſſerted in Scripture: Nay, and I will add, though ſo ſweetly experimented by the dear Saints of God, that they have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the very borders of Heaven in reſpect of it) is yet with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor no better than <hi>a dim unintilligible notion;</hi> and, as he ſpeaks a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>a private Enthuſiaſm:</hi> But why un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible? cannot the holy Spirit ſo illuſtrate and irradiate the heart, that the truth of Grace may appear to the Believer; that he may certainly ſee in his own heart, that this is precious Faith, and that is love in incorruption; and ſo of other Graces there: Or, what if it were unintelligible?

                     <hi>the love of Chriſt is a love to the perſon of a Believer; without conſidering any other qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than that he is ſuch an individual perſon; that is, the excellency of Chriſts love conſiſs in this, that he loves for no reaſon: Now I confeſs this is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful love, but wherein the excellency of it conſiſts, I cannot ſee: I am ſure we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that Man a Fool, who loves at this rate; we who are reaſonable Creatures, think that we are bound to govern all our
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:57359:302"/>actions, and the paſſions of our mind too, by reaſon; and we accouut it a reproach to a Man, to act either againſt reaſon or without it, to do any thing of which he cannot give a reaſonable account: And how that ſhould come to be the perfection of the Love of God, which is a reproach to Men, is above my apprehenſion? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were this true, it would undermine the very foundations of Religion: For the great end of Religion is to pleaſe God, and to procure his love and favour; but if God and Chriſt love for no reaſon, then it is a vain thing for us to think of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, or procuring his love by any thing we can do: Whether we obey him or disobey him, it is all one in this caſe; for if he pleaſe to love us without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, our ſins cannot hinder it; and if it does not pleaſe him to love us, our Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Obedience cannot alter him. When our Acceptation with God depends wholly upon a ſoveraign and unaccountable will, nothing we can do can hinder or promote it, and therefore all Religion is in vain. The foundation of this mistake is a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical nicety, that God muſt act wholly from himſelf, and therefore muſt not be moved by any external cauſe; whereas ſhould he love us becauſe we are holy, or hate us becauſe we are wicked, his love or
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:57359:302"/>hatred would depend upon an external cauſe:</hi> viz. <hi>The holyneſs or wickedneſs of Creatures, which unbecomes an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Being, to depend upon any thing elſe: The ſum of which reaſoning is this, that becauſe God is the first cauſe of all things, on whom all things depend, and he on nothing, therefore he muſt love or hate his Creature without any reaſon, but his own unaccountable will: For this is all the inconvenience they can Object, that when God loves or hates, rewards or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes his Creatures, the reaſon of this difference he makes between his Creatures, must be fetched from the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whom he thus loves or hates; and ſo it muſt of neceſſity be, if he have any reaſon at all; for the reaſon of love or hatred ought to be in the Object, not in the Perſon who loves or hates; and yet in propriety of ſpeech, God cannot be ſaid to depend on his Creatures, or any thing without himſelf, for the reaſon of his love or hatred, but his own Nature is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it: He is infinitely Holy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loves holyneſs and hates ſin; and his natural love to holyneſs is the reaſon why he loves holy Men, and his natural hatred to ſin, is the reaſon why he hates wicked Men: his own holyneſs is the reaſon why he loves holy Men, but the holyneſs of the
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:57359:303"/>Creature is the reaſon, why he determines his love to any particular perſon; And if they will call this a depending on creatures, we muſt acknowledge that God does thus depend on his Creatures, in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Providence, in diſtributions of rewards and puniſhments; and he ſhould not be wiſe, &amp; holy, and juſt, &amp; good if he did not, that is, if he did not put ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between things &amp; perſons, as their Natures require: It is a ſtrange notion of an independent Being, that he must have no other reaſon for what he does, but his own Arbitrary will; which is ſo far from being a perfection, that it deſtroys all the other perfections of the Divine Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a double love in God:<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> A love of complacence, whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in his own Holy Image in the Creature, where ever he finds it; And a love of Benevolence, whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to beſtow good things on his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: The firſt, points at goodneſs in the Creature; the other, is the great origen of all good things in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The firſt, Iſſues out of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſanctity of his Nature; The other, proceeds according to his Soveraign will and pleaſure. But then, ſaith the Author, <hi>God loves for no reaſon, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon.</hi> To which I anſwer, Gods
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:57359:303"/>love of Benevolence is no <hi>Caecus impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> there is <hi>ſumma ratio</hi> in it, it is irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated with infinite wiſdom; but the reaſon of it is not in the Creature, but in himſelf only: God would redeem fallen Men not Angels; but ſurely the reaſon was not in the Creature, for then all the Grace, Mercy, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in that work vaniſhes: The whole of it muſt proceed from the Nature of God, as it reſpects ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Creature, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it could not fall out otherwiſe, becauſe God cannot deny his Nature.

<pb n="578" facs="tcp:57359:304"/>he ſevered them from all other Nations unto himſelf; and was the reaſon in the Creature? No ſurely; they muſt not ſo much as ſay or mutter in their heart, <hi>That they had the Land for their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Deut. 9.4. No, God tells them, that they were a <hi>ſtiff-necked People,</hi> verſ. 6. but he choſe and <hi>loved them, becauſe he loved them,</hi> Deut. 7.7. and 8. What he did was meerly out of his good pleaſure, and without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on their part. God gives the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to ſome Nations, not to others; and is the reaſon in the Creature? No; the Apoſtle tells us: <hi>That God calls us not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and Grace,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. Chriſt was manifeſted to a Thief, and not to a <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato;</hi> Impenitent <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> had a viſible Deity before them in Chriſts Miracles, when poor <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> much nearer to Repentance, had it not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.21. Here the reaſon cannot be in the Creature, unleſs we will ſay with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius: Gratiam dari ſecundum merita, That Grace is given according to works.</hi> But to come to the Church, there God gives Faith and Repentance to one Man, not to another; and is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Creature? Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:57359:304"/>are the very firſt Graces in Men, &amp; therefore cannot be given to them for any precedent Grace in them, or indeed for any reaſon at all in them; unleſs, which is very odd, we preſume them to be given to them for the goodneſs of their Nature: The Scripture clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves it into the Soveraign will of God, <hi>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> Rom. 9.18. <hi>He begets us of his own will,</hi> Ja. 1.18. <hi>He begets us according to his abundant mercy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>He worketh to will &amp; to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Ph. 2.13. Neither is it poſſible to be otherwiſe; his love of Benevolence, is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and great Origen of all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Creature; and how or which way ſhall the goodneſs of the Creature be the cauſe or reaſon of that love? All the goodneſs in the Creature is but a donative of Divine love; and if ſo, then the Divine love was antecedent to that goodneſs in the Creature. Now theſe things being clearly ſo in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon, I ſuppoſe there is little reaſon, and leſs Religion, to ſay, That <hi>God loves for no reaſon, or without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; that that Man is a Fool who loves at this rate that it is a reproach among Men ſo to Act;</hi> with ſuch other ſtuff, which I pray God to forgive unto the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:57359:305"/>If there be reaſon for any thing in the World, there is for this: That God the ſupream Donor, ſhould do what he would with his own: That Man, the poor Receiver, ſhould not expoſtulate with God, or think to call him to an account for any of his matters: That the regenerating Spirit ſhould be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and breath where it liſts: That all Gods gifts ſhould be free, and of his good pleaſure, there being in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nothing that is good, but what is a meer gift only. But, ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>This undermines the foundations of Religion, if God love for no reaſon, whether we obey him or diſobey him, it is all one; if God love us our ſins cannot hinder it, if he love us not our holyneſs cannot alter him, therefore all Religion is but in vain.</hi> To which I anſwer, This Argument runs upon two or three hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes which are untrue: The Author ſuppoſes firſt, that God's purpoſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretive love is, what it is not, the rule of our acting; next, that there is in God what indeed there is not, ſome purpoſe or decree to bar ſome Men, though never ſo holy, out of Heaven. And Thirdly, That there is not, what in truth there is, a complacential love in God towards all holy Perſons whoever
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:57359:305"/>they be. Now, theſe things are not ſo, we ſay, that God commands all in the Church to Repent and Believe, that God hath made a general promiſe of Salvation to all that do ſo; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that God hath a complacential love towards all holy perſons whoever they be: And theſe things conſidered, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Religion cannot be in vain or to no purpoſe.</hi> As for the Philoſophical nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or verity rather, if God be, as he is, a God and the ſupream Donor of all; in reaſon, all Creatures as Creatures muſt depend on him the Creator, and as Receivers muſt depend on him the Donor: And hence it is evident, that all the grace and goodneſs in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe a Creature, muſt depend on him its Maker; And becauſe a gift muſt depend on him the Donor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Man, though but a petty Benefactor, is free in his gifts, or elſe they would not be gifts; how much more muſt God the ſupream Donor be ſo? It is true, when Men are good, God, ſuch is the ſanctity of his Nature, doth take pleaſure in them; but to diſpenſe grace or goodneſs to the Creature is his Royal prerogative, he doth it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſoveraign unaccountable pleaſure of his will; he was under no
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:57359:306"/>Natural neceſſity to give a Chriſt, or a Goſpel, or a dram of Faith or holyneſs, to any one fallen Man in the World, what he gives, he gives as he pleaſes out of meer Free grace. It is true too, when Men are good, God, ſuch is his gracious promiſe, will greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them; but it is he only who makes us good, and ſo meet for the inheritance in light; our goodneſs is of Grace, and our reward is Grace upon Grace, remunerating Grace upon ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying; In a word, the love of Gods Complacence reſpects goodneſs in the Creature, but the love of Benevolence cauſes it, and that freely in a way of unaccountable Soveraignty; and this is ſo far from being a love without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that without it, it is impoſſible that there ſhould be any goodneſs in the Creature: Were there a goodneſs in the Creature, antecedent to the love of his Benevolence, it would be a beam without a Sun, a gift without a Giver a ſtrange, independent, ſelf-originated goodneſs, and that in the Creature, which is as great an abſurdity as can well be imagine.</p>

<pb n="583" facs="tcp:57359:306"/>any reaſon,</hi> he can never alter: Sin it ſelf cannot ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt. If ſin foreſeen were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hinder him from planting his heart on us: How then ſhall it <hi>(that is, ſin committed)</hi> be able to over-turn the thoughts of his heart, when once they are fixed on us? <hi>This is a ſtrong fixed Love indeed, which ſin it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter: But how wiſe, and holy a Love it is, let any man judge: Herein Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>tells us</hi> the depth of Chriſts Love is to be contemplated, that whereas his holy Soul hates every ſin, it is a burden, an abomination, a new wound to him; and his poor Spouſe, that is, ſinful Believers are full of ſin, failings, infirmities, he hides all, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all, bears all, rather than he will looſe them. <hi>He adds indeed,</hi> by his power preſerving them from ſuch ſins, as a remedy is not provided for in the Covenant of Grace. <hi>I ſuppoſe he means the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt; for there is a remedy provided for all other ſins in the Covenant of Grace, and all other ſins a Believer it ſeems may be guilty of; and Chriſt will hide all rather than loſe him. Now this is as down-right Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm, as ever Dr.</hi> Criſp <hi>or</hi> Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſh <hi>vented; There have been, and are
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:57359:307"/>to this day a great many wiſe learned men, who contend for the perſeverance of the Saints, that thoſe, who are once in a ſtate of Grace, ſhall always continue ſo: But then they found this not on ſuch an immutable Love, as ſin it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter; for this is not reconcilable with the Holineſs of the Divine Nature; nor with thoſe threatnings in Scripture againſt ſuch back-ſliders:</hi> When the righteous man turneth away from his Righteouſneſs, and committeth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and doth according to all the abominations that a wicked man doth, he ſhall dye, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. If any man turn back, my ſoul ſhall have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in him, <hi>which is a plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the truth of which is which is acknowledged by all ſober Writers, that if ſuch men can be ſuppoſed to relapſe into a ſinful ſtate, God will ceaſe to love them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they found the immutability of Gods Love to them on their perſeverance in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, God loves all good men; but if they ceaſe to be good, he alſo muſt ceaſe to love: Herein the immutability of Gods Love conſiſts, not that he always loves the ſame perſon, but that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways loves for the ſame reaſon: For it is no perfection to be ſo fixt in our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that where we love once, we will
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:57359:307"/>always love, whatever reaſon there may be to alter our affections; for by this means we may love undeſerving Objects, which is the greateſt degeneracy of Love; but the perfection of Love conſiſts in loving deſerving Objects, and in loving upon honourable reaſons, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of Love conſists in loving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways for the ſame reaſons, which is the only foundation of a virtuous immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: The reaſon of Chriſts Love to any perſon is Holineſs and Obedience:</hi> If any love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him; and we will come to him, and make our abode with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. <hi>The unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Love is ſeen in this, that he will continue to love, while we continue to obey him:</hi> If ye ſhall keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; <hi>that is, continue to do ſo:</hi> Ye ſhall abide in my Love; <hi>I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to love you:</hi> As I have kept my Fathers Commandments, and abide in his Love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.20. <hi>This is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of the Divine Nature, that God always acts upon ſteddy, constant Principles, that whatever changes there are in the World, which may occaſion very different administrations in his providence; yet he is the ſame ſtill, and never changes: Whereas, ſhould God
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:57359:308"/>always love the ſame perſon; however he changed and altered, God muſt change and alter too; becauſe though he ſtill loves the ſame perſon; yet he muſt love for different or contrary reaſons, or for none at all; and that is the much greater change of the two, to alter the reaſon, than the Object of Love: If God love a good man, becauſe he is good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to love him, when he is wicked, his love is a mutable thing, which can love goodneſs or wickedneſs, which can love for none, or for contrary reaſons: But if God always loves true goodneſs, and good men, and never loves any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whatever change there be in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; God is the ſame ſtill, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in his Love.</hi>

                  <p>The Author admits an immutable Love in God towards goodneſs;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> but the Scripture aſſerts an immutable Love in God towards perſons: He <hi>hath choſen us before the foundation of the world,</hi> Eph. 1.4. Electing Love is eternal, and therefore immutable: <hi>Non enim eſt vera aeternitas, ubi orttur nova voluntas, nec eſt immortalis voluntas, quae alia et a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia eſt:</hi> An eternal choice muſt be ever the ſame, and after one there cannot riſe another. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal; the
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:57359:308"/>Lord knoweth them that are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. Election, which is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is ſure, and Gods fore-knowledge, which includes invariable Love in it, is the ſeal of it: The Book of Life hath all the names of the Elect written in it, and Gods Love is the Seal that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it; <hi>whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo justified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.30. This Golden Chain of Grace compriſes in it certain individual perſons, as the words (<hi>whom</hi> and <hi>them</hi>) which faſten every link of it, doth evidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and that which holds all the links of it together, is immutable Love: Nay, beſides Scripture evidence, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will evince this immutable Love of the Elect; without this there can be no deſign of a Church, and without the deſign of a Church, Chriſts blood muſt needs be ſhed irrationally, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a meer peradventure; I ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this there can be no deſign of a Church; for the deſign of a Church muſt compriſe in it, thoſe individual perſons, which ſhall make up a Church, and undertake that they ſhall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly believe and perſevere till they come to Heaven; it muſt firſt compriſe
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:57359:309"/>in it thoſe individual perſons which ſhall make up a Church, or elſe it is lame and imperfect, unworthy of the Divine Wiſdom and Perfection; run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning much after this rate, as if God ſhould ſay, I deſign a Church, but I care not of whom it conſiſts, which is much one, as if God ſhould deſign an Heaven, and not what Stars ſhould be in it; or an Earth, and not what Plants ſhould be there: <hi>All the members in mans body are written in Gods book,</hi> Pſal. 139.16. And can any man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that thoſe, who ſhould make up the Myſtical Body of Chriſt, as ſo many Members thereof, are not certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned? <hi>God calleth them by name,</hi> Joh. 10.3. <hi>Your names are all down in the Book of Life,</hi> Phil. 4.3. To deſign a Church, and not who, is too weak a thing for the all-wiſe Deity. Again, the deſign of a Church muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, that thoſe individual perſons ſhall believe and perſevere; unleſs this be granted, the deſign of a Church muſt be framed thus: God gives a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and a Goſpel in common, and over and above a power to men to believe and perſevere; and ſo, though the iſſue hang upon mans will, hopes for a Church: But in Truth, this is not
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:57359:309"/>to deſign a Church; but the poſſibility of one; there may be one, as it may happen, and there may be none: And is this like that Divine Providence, which is perfect in all things, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the great deſign of a Church? Nay, is it probable upon theſe terms, that any ſhould believe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere! Innocent <hi>Adam</hi> (and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! how ſoon was that Star ſhot?) was more likely to ſtand in his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, than any man ſince upon thoſe terms hath been to believe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere: The diſparity clears it. The Divine principles in <hi>Adam</hi> ſweetly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined him to obedience: But the power of believing in men doth not incline, but only put the will <hi>in aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librio.</hi> The Divine Principles in <hi>Adam,</hi> were pure and without mixture: But the power of believing hath in the ſame heart, where it dwells, an inmate of corruption, which continually coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-works it. In innocency the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtood without a courting the ſenſes: But after the Fall it makes nearer approaches, as having a party within ready to open and betray eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faculty. Theſe things conſidered, methinks every one, who with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eyes looks on that glaſs of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:57359:310"/>defectibility, which was made out of the broken pieces of fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhould conclude it very improbable, that any one in all the World upon thoſe terms ſhould believe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere; it being no leſs than a proud thought for any to imagine, that upon ſuch great diſparities he could act his part better than <hi>Adam</hi> did: And is it reaſonable, that God ſhould found the deſign of a Church upon ſuch improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities? The firſt Covenant, in which the ſtock of Grace was in mans own hand, and the ſtreſs of all lay upon his will, miſcarried and brought forth no happineſs to man; and can we imagine, that the All-wiſe God, who made the ſecond Covenant as a <hi>ſecunda tabulae</hi> to repair the ruines of the firſt, ſhould frame it in that very ſame way in which the firſt miſcarried? May the ſtock be in mans hand again, and his Bankrupt will truſtee a ſecond time? Will God hang up all upon a meer <hi>poſſe</hi> in the Creature, and expect it may do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in lapſed than innocent man? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! what miſerable <hi>ſpecimens</hi> hath Free-will given of it ſelf in fallen Man! The old World, left to their own Free-will (though, I ſuppoſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Author, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:57359:310"/>a <hi>poſſe</hi>) all but one <hi>Noah,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately corrupted themſelves, till the Flood ſwept them away: And for that one <hi>Noah,</hi> it is not probable or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed imaginable, that he, had he been left to himſelf only with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace afforded to the reſt, ſhould have done better than they; nay, it is a World againſt one man, that he would have corrupted himſelf as they did. After the flood (and that was a ſtartling warning-piece) hath free Will with the common Grace done better? All Nations have walked in their own ways, that is, in wayes of wickedneſs, affording us a vaſt experiment in milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, that free Will left to it ſelf will miſcarry, and come to nought; and withal a pregnant proof, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than ſpecial effectual Grace could ſecure a Church or ſo much as a ſingle <hi>Noah</hi> unto God. Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, I conclude that the deſign of a Church doth not only give a power to believe and perſevere, but Faith and Perſeverance to thoſe individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which make up a Church; Hence our Saviour tells us, <hi>that all that the Father giveth him, ſhall come to him,</hi> Joh. 6.37. that is, ſhall believe and make up his myſtical Body; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:57359:311"/>
                     <hi>that it was his Fathers will, that none of them ſhould be loſt,</hi> verſ. 39. that is, that they ſhould perſevere unto the end. Now after all this diſcourſe, if there be ſuch a deſign of a Church, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes in it thoſe individual perſons which ſhall make up a Church, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures Faith and Perſeverance unto them, then the love of God towards them can be no leſs than immutable, pitching upon them in election, and carrying of them through Faith and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance unto glory. Having ſaid thus much to eſtabliſh the point, I now ſhall attend the Authors objections, firſt he tells us. <hi>That ſin it ſelf cannot ſeparate us from this immutable Love.</hi> Very well; I acknowledge it, that immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Love, which gives Faith and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance to his People, preſerves them ſo, that ſin, any other than unavoida-infirmity, ſhall not be at all; or if it be, ſhall not finally be in them: They ſhall not ſin ſuch ſins, or if they do, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace ſhall raiſe them up by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>They are,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath it, <hi>preſerved from ſuch ſins, for which a remedy is not provided in the Covenant of Grace;</hi> that is, not only, as the Author gloſſes, <hi>from the ſin againſt the Holy Ghost,</hi> but from final Impenitency too;
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:57359:311"/>which is not remedied in the Covenant of Grace: If they ſin, they ſhall not lie in it by final Apoſtacy &amp; Impenitency, &amp; conſequently they ſhall never fall under ſuch threatnings againſt Backſliders and Apoſtates as that mentioned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. and in other Scriptures: and what <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm</hi> there is in this I know not; neither can I ſee how that Love, which preſerves from final Impenitency, ſhould want Wiſdom or Holineſs. The Author goes on; <hi>Many wiſe learned men there are, who contend for Perſeverance; but they found Gods immutable Love on their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance:</hi> To which I anſwer, I know no ſuch: They, who are for Perſeverance, do not found Gods immutable love, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, but perſeverance on Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable love, which cauſeth the ſame: Thus <hi>Fulgentius, Deus, Praedestinationè ſuâ &amp; donu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Illuminationis ad credendum, &amp; donu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Perſeverantiae ad permanendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; donu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Glorificationis ad regnandu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quibus dare voluit praeparavit; nec aliter perficit in opere quàm in ſua ſempiterna &amp; incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutabili voluntate habet diſpoſitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> Faith, Perſeverance Glory, all are the effluxes of immutable Love. But the Author fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tells us <hi>That the Immutability of Gods love conſiſts in this not that he always loves the ſame perſon, but that he always loves for
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:57359:312"/>ſame reaſon; he always loves true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good men, and never loves any other, and ſo is unchangeable:</hi> To which I anſwer, God loves good men with a Love of Complacence; he cannot love a wicked man with a Love of Complacence; but may he not love him with a Love of Benevolence? Then he cannot deſign the leaſt good to any fallen Man in the World, all being by Nature wicked, and children of wrath: If God love good men, and never loved any other, then he could not deſign to lapſed corrupt Man, a Chriſt, or a Goſpel, or any the leaſt means of Salvation: Goodneſs, the only reaſon of Love being gone by the Fall, nothing that is good can be intended to man: <hi>This,</hi> as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells us, <hi>would be the degeneracy of Love, to love an undeſerving object;</hi> &amp; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man by Nature is no better: <hi>It is,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>the greateſt change of all to alter the reaſon of Love;</hi> and therefore according to this Principle, God (as he would be a Self-preſerver, and not ſuffer a Change in himſelf) having loved innocent Man, was bound not to love fallen Man; not to give him a Chriſt, or a Goſpel, or any good thing. But rather than run our ſelves into ſuch Conſequences, I think we were as
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:57359:312"/>good ſay, God's Love of Complacence is towards good men, but his Love of Benevolence is towards men, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are good, and is the fontal Cauſe of all that after-goodneſs in them which is the Object of his Complacence. As for that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. <hi>If a man keep my words, my Father will love him,</hi> the meaning is, God will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf unto him, as it is, <hi>ver.</hi> 21 <hi>I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf unto him:</hi> If God did not love him before, whence came his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? It muſt be an odd independent Self-originated Obedience, which came not from the Grace or Love of the great Donor.</p>

                        <hi>Mr</hi> Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</note> ſo we muſt in requital to him love the Perſon of Chriſt: <hi>This is as certain as any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration in</hi> Euclide, <hi>that if we love Chriſt, we muſt love his Perſon; for the Perſon of Chriſt is Chriſt himſelf, and if we love Chriſt, we muſt love him: But this will not ſerve their turn; they oppoſe our love to the Perſon of Christ to our
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:57359:313"/>love to him upon account of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, to our love to our ſelves, and to our duties.</hi> Firſt, we muſt love the Perſon of Chriſt in oppoſition to his Benefits; <hi>that is, we muſt not conſider what advantages we do or may receive from Chriſt, what he hath done or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us, but we muſt love his Perſon purely for himſelf without any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to endear him to us. This matter is gravely ſtated and determined by</hi> W.B. <hi>who tells us,</hi> 1. That it is a good and lawful thing to love Chriſt in reference to his benefits: <hi>This is a very liberal grant,; that Gratitude, which hath hitherto been accounted a great and excellent Virtue, is now owned as a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing.</hi> 2. It is our duty to love Chriſt's Perſon: <hi>This is ſo true, that thoſe men, who love Christ for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, love his Perſon:</hi> 3. The Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſt's Perſon is not the Object of my Faith, but Chriſt crucified: 4. Though Chriſt crucified be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my Faith, yet the perſonal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of Chriſt are the Object of my Love; yea, it is a more excellent thing yet to love the Perſon of Chriſt, than the Benefits of Chriſt; to have my heart drawn out in love to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, than to have it drawn
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:57359:313"/>out in love to him for his Benefits. <hi>Now what can be the meaning of all this, but that the Excellency and Perfection of our Love to Chriſt conſiſts in loving him for no reaſon: The proper object and reaſon of Love is Goodneſs; to love that which is good for nothing is the folly and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of Love; and it is as fooliſh and impoſſible a task to love a perſon, who hath been good to us, not becauſe he hath been good, but for no reaſon. Now this is the caſe here; for if you ſeparate the Perſon and perſonal Excellencies of Chriſt from the conſideration of his benefits, his perſonal Goodneſs from the expreſſions of his Love and Goodneſs to our ſelves and others, it can be no Object or reaſon of our Love: for a Goodneſs which doth no good, or never did any, or, which is all one, is conſidered as doing none, is ſo far from being the Object of our Love, that it is not the Object of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding: For we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what that Goodneſs means, which never did any good. God chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges our Love, not upon account of an imaginary Goodneſs of Nature, which never did any good; but for the real and ſenſible Effects of his Goodneſs in the works of Creation and Providence, and Redemption by Chriſt: And Chriſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:57359:314"/>our love for the like reaſons; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath loved us, and died for us, and now intercedes for us, and will at the laſt day beſtow a Crown of Glory and Immortality on us, but never, as I can obſerve,, requires ſuch an abſtracted and Metaphyſical Love to his Perſon, without any reſpect to his benefits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We love Chriſt for his Benefits,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> theſe are the firſt impulſives of our Love; but our love, once kindled, is afterwards blown up into a purer flame by thoſe attractive Excellencies and raviſhing Beauties, which are in the Perſon of Chriſt; we come to love Chriſt for himſelf. The Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> did not only love Chriſt for his Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and ſweet fruits, for the Graces and Benefits communicated from him, but for himſelf, his incomparable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>who is the chiefeſt among ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and altogether lovely.</hi> Neither is this Love to Chriſt for himſelf (what the Author would have it to be) <hi>a Love for no reaſon, or a Love in its folly and degeneracy:</hi> But it is a Love for the greateſt Reaſon, and a Love in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. There is a greater worthineſs and ſo an higher attractive of our Love in the Perſon of Chriſt than in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; and therefore in all reaſon Love
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:57359:314"/>is in a more high and ſuperlative mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure due to the one than to the other. All the Benefits of Chriſt are but as ſo many <hi>Mediums</hi> to draw up and attract our Love to the Perſon of Chriſt, and our Love in its aſcent up thither, muſt not ſtay or take up its final reſt in Means (for this would be to pervert the nature of Means and transform them into Ends;) but it muſt termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in Chriſt the great End and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Should we love the Benefits more than the Perſon of Chriſt, we ſhould be lovers of our ſelves more than lovers of Chriſt; our Love would then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and circulate into our ſelves, and there reſt and center <hi>ut in ultimo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino,</hi> which is no leſs than Idolatry. If we are truly eſpouſed to Chriſt, we will not love the Rings and Jewels, more than himſelf; nay, nor ſo much: The true noble Lover doth not acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in other gifts, but in Chriſt, the Gift above all other gifts. But, ſaith the Author, <hi>A Goodneſs, which doth no good, or never did any, is ſo far from being the object of our Love, that it is not the object of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> To which I anſwer, It's true, if God had never done good, that is, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver created a Creature, he could not
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:57359:315"/>have been the Object of any created Love or Underſtanding; for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Creation, there could have been no ſuch thing as any created Love or Underſtanding; however he had been an Object for a greater Love and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding than any created one, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his own infinite Love and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Had he never created a Creature, he would have been for ever happy by amatorious and intellectual Reflections upon himſelf, and his own Perfections. It is true that God calls for our Love upon account of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Providence and Redemption; but it is due to him for himſelf, for his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Excellency and All-ſufficiency. Could we imagine, what is impoſſible, that there were a rational Creature, who never received any good from God, upon ſuch a ſuppoſal, that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would be bound to love God for his intrinſecal Goodneſs and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; or elſe the Will of that Creature might, which is very ſtrange, paſs by the Supreme Good unſaluted. But to leave that Suppoſition; now we have God and many bleſſings before our eyes, we are bound to love God above all, as the complete and adequate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Love: Should we love any
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:57359:315"/>Bleſſings without or above him, it would be <hi>Cupiditas, Luſt,</hi> (which is the <hi>formale</hi> of every ſin) and not Love. I conclude with that of <hi>Bonaventure,</hi>

<pb n="604" facs="tcp:57359:317"/>of Faith and Love to honour him: Here is the ſtrongeſt difficulty of all to row againſt the ſtream, to hate a mans ſelf, <hi>(our own ſouls and eternal Salvation)</hi> and then to follow Chriſt fully: <hi>Now is it not an hard caſe, that before we can love God and Chriſt, as we ought, we muſt root out the very princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all love, that we may learn to hate Salvation and Eternal Happineſs, before we can cloſe with Chriſt for Salvation! This is the ſtrongeſt difficulty of all; for indeed it is impoſſible: Love to our ſelves is the foundation of our love to all other things, even to God himſelf: He that doth not love himſelf, will love nothing elſe; he that hates himſelf, his own ſoul, and deſpiſes eternal Salvation, will not care for Chriſt or Salvation by him: All the Motives and Arguments of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to perſwade us to love and fear, and obey God, are founded on ſelf-love; for how is it poſſible, that we ſhould be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a due ſenſe of Gods goodneſs to us? That we ſhould be excited and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the hopes of ſuch great rewards? That we ſhould be reſtrained and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fears of puniſhment? If we did not love our ſelves, if we did not care what became of us; whether we were

It is a vain thing to perſwade a man not to love himſelf: For this is as natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as it is for the Fire to burn, or Sun to ſhine: It is not matter of our choice; it is not in our power to do otherwiſe, all that ſuch diſcourſes as theſe can do, is either to make men hypocrites to pretend to do what they cannot do, or to make honest men, who cannot thus cheat and delude themſelves, deſpair of their Salvation, becauſe they cannot find themſelves contented without Salvation, that Christ without Salvation cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them.

                     <hi>who wants an inward principle of love to God and Chriſt, that he doth all for himſelf, he ſleeps, prayes, hears, ſpeaks, profeſſes, for himſelf alone, that he commits the highest degree of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and makes himſelf a God:</hi> And adds this reaſon; <hi>For a man puts himſelf in the room of God, as well by making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his</hi> finis ultimus, <hi>as if he ſhould make himſelf</hi> primum principium: And is there any queſtion at all in this? may not a wicked man (not to ſay, ſleep, which every man doth) but pray, hear, ſpeak, profeſs? No doubt can be made of it, and if he do ſo, it muſt needs be for himſelf; he having, whilſt wicked, no Divine Principle, nothing of grace to elevate him above himſelf: But Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi> would have men <hi>go out of themſelves to Chriſt:</hi> And <hi>this is hard to row against the stream, to hate a mans ſelf: And,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>this is impoſſible, this is to root up the very principle of Love: Love to our ſelves is the foundation of our Love to all other things, even to God himſelf.</hi> To which I anſwer: No doubt we are to love Chriſt for the purchaſed Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:57359:318"/>neither doth Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi> deny it, but we are not to love him for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, only or ſupremely, no, but for himſelf, his infinite goodneſs and perfection: This is not to root up the principle Love, but to rectifie it: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is hard: Nay, I may add unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by lapſed nature in it ſelf: but Grace elevates nature above it ſelf, to love Chriſt (though not without a reſpect to Salvation) yet above our ſelves, and ſo in a comparative ſence to hate our ſelves for him: Indeed, if love to our ſelves were (as the Author would have it) the foundation of our Love to God, then it muſt be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it too; and by conſequence we ſhould not need love God above our ſelves; and our love of God might, for ought I ſee, center and ultimately terminate in our ſelves: But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be allowed; As long as God is God, the ſupreme good and laſt end, he muſt be loved above all, and for himſelf; that inclination, which is in us to love our ſelves more than God, is, as <hi>Bonaventure</hi> well obſerves, <hi>not the perfection, but the corruption of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: But,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>he that doth not love or care for himſelf, will not love God.</hi> To which I anſwer: If
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:57359:319"/>we do not care for our ſelves in a way of fooliſh neglect, we are unnatural to our ſelves, and want true love to God: But if we care not for our ſelves in a Paroxiſm of holy Zeal for God, as when <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, <hi>to be blotted out of Gods book:</hi> Or when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed himſelf <hi>accurſed from Chriſt:</hi> then our love to God is very great and fervent; if, whilſt we pay that <hi>debitum naturae,</hi> love to our ſelves; We ſubordinate it to the love of God, loving God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our ſelves, and in that ſence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively not eſtimating our ſelves; then our love to God is true, and as it ought to be: We need not make men hypocrites or deſperate, we need not break any of the ſweet links, duty and intereſt may well conſiſt together, our love to God, and our love to our ſelves may ſtand in conjunction; yet ſtill our love muſt keep its <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi> we muſt have a higher reſpect for Duty than for intereſt; and our love to God muſt be ſuperlative, and above our love to our ſelves.</p>

<pb n="609" facs="tcp:57359:319"/>
                     <hi>(which you know is a great marriage du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)</hi> in not taking any thing <hi>(as our own righteouſneſs)</hi> into our affection and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem; for thoſe ends and purpoſes for which we have received Chriſt; and God forbid that any Chriſtian ſhould, for our own Righteouſneſs and Duties, cannot be our Mediators and Advocates: <hi>What then is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? Why it is only this: The</hi> Doctor <hi>places the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, in the room of our righteouſneſs, to be not only the foundation, but the condition of the Covenant of Grace, and then makes it an expreſſion of our chaste affection to Christ, quite to thruſt out our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and to allow it no place in our Religion: He makes Chriſt</hi> all to us, and leaves no room for any thing elſe, <hi>and then warns us</hi> upon our vows of chaſtity, not to take any thing into Chriſt's place; <hi>Whereas, as he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter, we muſt take our own righteouſneſs into Chriſt's place, or elſe caſt it quite away; for there is no other place left for it: But is it not very ſtrange, that when our Saviour hath made our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience the principal expreſſion of our Love to him: Theſe men ſhould make ſuch a competition between our Love to Christ, and our Obedience? ſhould put
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:57359:320"/>ſuch jealouſies into peoples heads: What great danger there is of their own Duties and Righteouſneſs;</hi> leſt they ſhould prove like fooliſh Lovers,<note place="margin">Sincere Convert.</note> who, when they are to wooe for the Lady, fall in love with the Hand-maid. Men dote upon Duties, and reſt in the naked performance of them, <hi>(that is, in doing good)</hi> which are only Hand-maids to lead to Chriſt. <hi>Is not this to perſwade people, that our love to Chriſt conſiſts in ſomething more refined, and ſpiritual than obedience? Which will quickly teach them to love Chriſt without obeying of him, and not run the hazard of doting on duties.</hi>

                     <hi>how they expreſs their love to the perſon of Chriſt, and that conſists</hi> in preferring Chriſt above all, they value him above all other things and perſons, above their lives, above all Spiritual Excellencies, and other Righteouſneſs whatever; he is their Joy, Crown, Life, Food, Health, Strength, Defire, Righteouſneſs, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

<pb n="618" facs="tcp:57359:324"/>loſe it ſelf, and ſtand in a maze at ſuch an Union: That Chriſt is to be highly prized by us; we need go no further, than the raptures and extatical paſſions of the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> which are a kind of Commentary on that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, which is the <hi>genius</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis ſenſus</hi> of Chriſtians: Nature it ſelf reveils God to be the great Object of Worſhip; but the Goſpel aſſures us that there is no acceſs, no coming to God but by Chriſt; That there is no Righteouſneſs able to cover our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and duties with the defects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of but Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; That there is no doing Duties in a right and ſpiritual way acceptable unto God, but by the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt; and upon theſe ſtrong important Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Goſpel calls and preſſes upon men to come to Chriſt; and therefore all Evangelical Duties (becauſe they are by infinite Wiſdom framed in a perfect Symmetry to the Goſpel) muſt needs be, not to ſay <hi>Cock-boats</hi> and <hi>Skullers,</hi> but Divine <hi>Mediums</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances to <hi>have us over to Chriſt;</hi> without whom we cannot have any acceſs to God, or ſtanding before him, or power to do any thing in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and acceptable manner. Sermons
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:57359:324"/>are to inſtruct us in our Duty, not as if we could do any thing truly and ſpiritually as of our ſelves: But that in the ſenſe of our own weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, we may be drawn to Chriſt, the Wiſdom and Power of God; who can teach us inwardly, and impower us by his Grace to do the Will of God: In Prayer we are to have a ſenſe of the Divine Majeſty, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and expreſs our truſt in him: But a true ſenſe of the Divine Majeſty tells us, that we muſt not approach im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thither without Chriſt our Mediator, that our truſt and other acts of Worſhip muſt find their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance only in and through Chriſt: Sorrow for ſin without coming to Chriſt and prizing him, is ſo far from being repentance unto life, that it drives a man down into the Black Gulf of horror and deſperation. The Nature of Religion is not now changed, but only turned into ſuch a Channel, as is congruous to fallen man, that all acceſs and acceptance with God may be in a Mediator, and all Grace and Glory may be from him. Morality is a beauty, and good <hi>in ſuo genere;</hi> but (becauſe it ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices only to Reaſon, and Reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:57359:325"/>ſupply the room of a Mediator) it muſt needs fall much below that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Religion, which would have all tranſacted through a Mediator: Sermons, Prayers, Confeſſions, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations are Divine <hi>Media:</hi> But, if we ſtay in the means, and never arrive at the Mediator, we pervert the means from their true end, and fall ſhort of that ſcope, to which they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; poſſibly the phraſe, <hi>have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Chriſt,</hi> may to ſome have but a rough aſpect; yet the thing is as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable as can be imagined, its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance being no more than that the whole managery of Religion muſt be in and through a Mediator.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, whether <hi>theſe men have transformed Religion, disfigured the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, undermined the fundamental de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it; miſrepreſented the ends of Chriſt's coming, abuſed his Expiation, Sacrifice, Righteouſneſs, interceſſion to the patronage of Vice, laid Snares to betray ſome men to a licentious life, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle others in endleſs troubles, have under pretence of advancing the perſon of Christ, baniſhed his Religion out of the world?</hi> I ſhall leave to the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader. <hi>Narciſſus</hi> the old Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> laboured a while under
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:57359:325"/>grievous accuſations: But at laſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence brought forth his innocency as clear as the Light: However, good old Truths may be clouded, and aſperſed for a time; yet ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they will appear again in their lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, recommending themſelves to the Conſciences of all true Chriſtians.</p>
